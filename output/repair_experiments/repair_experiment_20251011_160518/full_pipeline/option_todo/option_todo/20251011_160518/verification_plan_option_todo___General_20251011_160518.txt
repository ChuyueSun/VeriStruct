## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines an enum "MyOption" with several functions containing “TODO: add specification” and “TODO: add requires and ensures.”
- There is no mention of “View” or “TODO: add View.”
- There is no mention of “TODO: add invariants” or any explicit type invariants.

Dependencies:
- The functions is_Some, is_None, get_Some_0, Or depend on open specs that need to be filled in.
- The methods or, is_some, is_none, as_ref, and unwrap require specifications for their behavior.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
Since there are specification placeholders (“TODO: add specification,” “TODO: add requires and ensures”) with no mention of “View” or invariants, the code only requires function specification inference. There is no need for invariants or view refinement steps.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No – the code does not require any new type invariants.
- proof_generation: No – there are no “TODO: add proof” or “TODO: add invariants” markers in the code.
```
