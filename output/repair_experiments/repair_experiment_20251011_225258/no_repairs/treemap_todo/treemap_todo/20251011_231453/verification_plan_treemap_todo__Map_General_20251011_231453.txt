## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The TreeMap struct has a type invariant (well_formed) and an implementation of the View trait.
- Multiple “TODO” markers are present:
  - "TODO: add specification" for as_map() and view().
  - "TODO: add requires and ensures" for new(), insert(), delete(), get().
  - "TODO: add proof" blocks in insert().
- The code clearly references a tree data structure using a BST property, hence a class/struct with invariants.

Identified Missing Components:
- Explicit function specifications (requires, ensures) for all public methods.
- The specification bodies for as_map() and view() are not provided.
- Proof bodies to fulfill the “TODO: add proof” sections.

Critical Verification Challenges:
- Ensuring that the BST invariants hold throughout operations (insert, delete).
- Providing a View-based abstraction consistent with the type_invariant.
- Correctly specifying preconditions and postconditions to reflect the BST's map representation.

Dependencies:
- The Node module’s specification and functions are needed to maintain the tree structure correctness.
- well_formed() depends on the node's well_formed() method.
- The tree’s map representation depends on Node::optional_as_map.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
- The code explicitly implements the View trait for the TreeMap, which triggers the Full Sequence Workflow.
- The data structure is a struct with type invariants (well_formed).
- There are placeholders for function specifications (“TODO: add requires and ensures”) and view methods (“TODO: add specification”), and also a need to finalize invariants and proofs.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference (applicable because TreeMap is a struct with a type invariant)
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation (added due to “TODO: add proof” markers)

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes — the code has a struct (TreeMap) with #[verifier::type_invariant].
- proof_generation: Yes — “TODO: add proof” is present in the code.
```
