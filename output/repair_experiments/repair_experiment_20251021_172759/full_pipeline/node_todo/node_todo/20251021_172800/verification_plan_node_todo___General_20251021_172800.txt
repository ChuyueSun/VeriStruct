```markdown
Current State:
- The code is a binary search tree node struct requiring an invariant for BST correctness (“TODO: add invariant”).
- Multiple function placeholders also request requires/ensures (“TODO: add requires and ensures”).
- No explicit “View” trait implementation or “TODO: add View” is present.

Dependencies:
- The Node<V> struct needs an invariant describing BST ordering.
- Each insert/delete/get function depends on the BST invariant and must specify pre- and post-conditions accordingly.

```

**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
The code contains a struct (Node<V>) and explicitly needs invariants (BST property). It also has “TODO: add requires and ensures,” so both invariants and specifications are needed. There is no direct requirement to implement a “View” trait, ruling out the Full Sequence Workflow.

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference
3. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – input is a class/struct data structure needing BST invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes – there is a “TODO: add invariant” indicating proofs are required.
```
