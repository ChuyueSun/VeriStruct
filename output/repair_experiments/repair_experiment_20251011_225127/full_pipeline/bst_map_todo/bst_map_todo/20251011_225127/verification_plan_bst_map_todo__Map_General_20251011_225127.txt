Current State:
- The code is a TreeMap and Node data structure with BST properties, which already includes a type invariant.
- "View" is explicitly implemented for TreeMap, but the view function is not fully specified (TODO markers).
- Multiple TODOs require adding specifications (requires/ensures) and proofs.
- Thus, both View-related steps and invariant/spec additions are needed.

Dependencies:
- TreeMap’s correctness depends on Node’s BST property invariants.
- The View trait requires a complete map representation method.
- Many functions require well-formedness proofs and updated specifications.

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
We see an explicit "impl View for TreeMap<V>" which triggers the Full Sequence Workflow.
Additionally, TreeMap and Node are structs requiring invariants, so the optional inv_inference step must be included.
There are also TODOs for proofs, thus final proof_generation is needed.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes, because TreeMap and Node are data structures with invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes, because there are “TODO: add proof” placeholders present.
```
