Current State:
- The code defines a struct Lock<T> with invariants needed for its internal AtomicBool field.
- There is a placeholder "TODO: add specification" in Lock<T>::well_formed, indicating missing struct invariants or commentary.
- The function take has "TODO: add requires and ensures", indicating missing function specifications.
- There is also a "TODO: add invariant" placeholder within the loop of take.
- No "View" functions or "TODO: add View" markers are present.

Dependencies:
- The Lock<T> struct’s invariant (well_formed) must be consistent with how the AtomicBool is used.
- The take function’s specification will rely on the type invariant of Lock<T>.

**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
Because the code contains a struct (Lock<T>) needing type invariants and also has specification-related placeholders ("TODO: add requires and ensures"), but no mention of View functions, the correct workflow is Invariant-First. We first infer and establish necessary invariants, then proceed to infer the function specification.

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – Lock<T> is a struct that needs type invariants.
- proof_generation: No – the code does not contain the exact text "TODO: add proof" or "TODO: add invariants" as specified.
