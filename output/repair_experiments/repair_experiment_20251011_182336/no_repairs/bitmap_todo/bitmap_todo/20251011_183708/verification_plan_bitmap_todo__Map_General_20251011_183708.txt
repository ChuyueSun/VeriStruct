Current State:
- The code defines a BitMap struct with a placeholder "spec fn view(&self) -> Seq<bool>" that is not implemented yet.
- There are multiple "TODO" markers requesting proofs, loop invariants, and requires/ensures in methods of BitMap.
- Key missing components are the view function implementation, function specifications, type invariants, and proof obligations.

Dependencies:
- The BitMap struct depends on a correct view function for formal specification.
- The set_bit and or methods depend on proofs ensuring correct bit manipulations and loop invariants.
- The requires/ensures clauses for methods also depend on correct type invariants and the view abstraction to maintain consistency.

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
This BitMap struct explicitly includes a "spec fn view" placeholder, triggering the need for a full View-based verification workflow. It is also a data structure, so type invariants are applicable. Furthermore, there are "TODO: add proof" markers, indicating the final proof_generation step.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes, because BitMap is a struct needing an invariant.
- proof_generation: Yes, because "TODO: add proof" markers exist in the code.
