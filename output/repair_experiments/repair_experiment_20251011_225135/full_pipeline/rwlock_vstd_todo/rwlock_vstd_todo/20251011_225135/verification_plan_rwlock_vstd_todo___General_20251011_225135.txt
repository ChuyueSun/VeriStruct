Current State:
- The code defines a struct "FixedParity" implementing the trait RwLockPredicate<u64>, but its spec function "inv" is left unfinished with "TODO: add specification".
- There is a data-structure-like struct ("FixedParity") needing an invariant/spec, but no explicit mention of "TODO: add View" or view-function refinement.
- No "TODO: add proof" or "TODO: add invariants" is present.

Dependencies:
- "FixedParity" struct depends on defining its predicate logic in inv.
- The RwLock uses the Pred::inv internally, so finishing FixedParity::inv is necessary for a consistent specification.

**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
Because there is a struct (FixedParity) that needs an invariant/predicate function, and there is also a specification placeholder ("TODO: add specification"), the code matches the scenario for an Invariant-First Workflow. There is no requirement for new or refined "View" functions, so we do not use the Full Sequence Workflow.

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – "FixedParity" is a struct needing its predicate defined.
- proof_generation: No – there is no "TODO: add proof" or "TODO: add invariants" present.
```
