Current State:
- The code defines a struct BitMap with an unfinished spec fn view, indicating the need for a View implementation.
- Multiple "TODO" comments indicate missing specifications (requires/ensures) and a missing proof block for set_bit (and possibly others).
- There is a struct data structure with references to maintaining invariants, but no explicit type invariant has been written yet.

Dependencies:
- The BitMap struct’s methods (from, get_bit, set_bit, or) depend on a properly defined view function for abstraction.
- Proper function specifications (requires/ensures) depend on the view function to link implementation to the bit-sequence abstraction.
- Proofs also depend on the final specifications and the refined view.


**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
We have an explicit View function that needs implementation ("TODO: implement view"), which requires the Full Sequence Workflow. There is also a struct (BitMap) for which type invariants may be useful, so inv_inference is included. Additionally, there are several "TODO: add proof" placeholders, so we append a proof_generation step at the end.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes — we have a class/struct (BitMap) that can benefit from invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes — "TODO: add proof" is present in the code.
