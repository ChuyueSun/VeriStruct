# Git Commit Guide - Fixing Pre-commit Hooks

## What Happened:
Pre-commit hooks auto-formatted files (black, isort, end-of-file-fixer, trailing-whitespace)
But there were conflicts with stashed changes, so it rolled back.

## Solution:

### Step 1: Stage all your changes
```bash
git add -A
```

### Step 2: Commit again (hooks will auto-fix)
```bash
git commit -m "update example selection and dynamic prompting"
```

The hooks will:
- Auto-format Python files (black, isort)
- Add newlines at end of files
- Remove trailing whitespace
- This time it will succeed because everything is staged!

### Step 3: If hooks still modify files
```bash
git add -A  # Stage the auto-fixes
git commit --no-verify -m "update example selection and dynamic prompting"
```

## Alternatively: Let hooks fix everything first
```bash
# Run pre-commit on all files
pre-commit run --all-files

# Then stage and commit
git add -A
git commit -m "update example selection and dynamic prompting"
```
