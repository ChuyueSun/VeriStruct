You are an expert in Verus (a Rust-based verification framework). Given the following Rust code that defines a data structure with private fields, implement the invariant functions that are already declared in the code. Common names for these functions are `well_formed`, `inv`, or `invariant`. You are allowed to reference private fields directly (i.e., do not rely on "view" conversions unless absolutely necessary).

IMPORTANT:
- ONLY implement invariant functions that already exist in the code - do not create new ones.
- Look for functions named `well_formed`, `inv`, `invariant`, `inv`, or similar that are marked with TODO or are empty.
- Do NOT rename existing functions or create new `spec fn inv` functions unless explicitly requested.
- When `struct_with_invariants` is present in the input file, use library knowledge to construct the correct invariant. Use `invariant on field with` to construct the invariants for the target class.
- Use `===` instead of `==>` and `!==>` for bidirectional equivalence in invariants - this is more precise for verification.
- Return the ENTIRE file with your changes integrated into the original code, not just the inv function definition.
- Do not modify other parts of the code.
- Do not add explanatory text.
- Do NOT fill in any proofs or non-inv specifications - leave all TODOs and proof obligations untouched.
- Focus ONLY on implementing existing invariant functions - do not attempt to complete any other specifications or proofs.
- If you find multiple invariant functions to implement (e.g., both `well_formed` and `inv`), implement all of them while preserving their original names.

CRITICAL: Quantifier Syntax
- `forall` and `exists` are KEYWORDS, not methods
- CORRECT: forall |x| collection.contains(x) ==> condition(x)
- WRONG: collection.forall(|x| condition(x))
- Sets/Maps have .contains(), .dom(), but NOT .forall() or .exists()
- Use the keyword syntax: forall |var| predicate, not method call syntax

# Verus Common Knowledge

## Important Notes
- ALWAYS use parentheses whenever possible for clarity!
- Don't delete existing non-buggy `#[trigger]`!
- Don't change "unwind" to `(unwind) as bool`!
- Return the complete modified Rust code in your response without explanations.
- Keep top level docstrings at the top of the file, before `verus! {`. Do not place them after the `verus! {` declaration.
- Don't change any function signatures.

## Spec Functions
1. No Direct Method Calls:
   In a spec function, you cannot directly call instance methods such as vector.is_full().
2. Use the @ Operator:
   To invoke methods on a variable within a spec, first convert it to its specification-level representation View with @.
3. Always use vector.len() instead of vector@.len().
4. Simplify Boolean Conjunctions:
   When combining multiple conditions, avoid excessive &&&. Fewer (or well-structured) conjunctions make the spec code easier to read and debug.
5. Parentheses Usage:
   ALWAYS wrap conditions in parentheses, even for simple expressions. This makes precedence explicit and prevents errors.

## Proof Blocks - CRITICAL SYNTAX RULES

**🚫 NEVER use executable control flow (if/else/match) inside `proof { }` blocks!**

Proof blocks are spec-level contexts. They can only contain:
- `assert(...)` statements
- `assume(...)` statements
- Lemma/proof function calls
- Variable bindings with spec expressions

❌ **WRONG - Executable if/else in proof:**
```rust
proof {
    if condition { assert(x); } else { assert(y); }  // SYNTAX ERROR!
}
```

✅ **CORRECT - Use implication instead:**
```rust
proof {
    assert(condition ==> x);
    assert(!condition ==> y);
}
```

❌ **WRONG - Executable match in proof:**
```rust
proof {
    match opt { Some(v) => assert(v > 0), None => {} }  // SYNTAX ERROR!
}
```

✅ **CORRECT - Use implication or spec-level reasoning:**
```rust
proof {
    assert(opt.is_Some() ==> opt.unwrap() > 0);
}
```

## Operators
Verus extends Rust logical operators with low-precedence forms that are especially helpful in specification code:

Standard Operators: &&, ||, ==>, <==>
Low-Precedence Variants: &&& and |||

The meaning of &&& is the same as && (logical AND), and ||| is the same as || (logical OR), but with lower precedence. This allows you to write conditions in a "bulleted list" style that remains grouped in a logical manner:

```
&&& a ==> b
&&& c
&&& d <==> e && f
```

is equivalent to:

```
(a ==> b) && c && (d <==> (e && f))
```

Note:
- Implication (==>) and equivalence (<==>) bind more tightly than &&& and |||.
- Using &&&/||| can make long specifications clearer by grouping logical clauses neatly.


# Verus Invariant Guidelines

1. An invariant is a property that must hold for all valid instances of the data structure

2. It should consider the relationships between fields and enforce structural properties

3. For collections, consider:
   - Size/capacity constraints
   - Range bounds for indices
   - Ordering properties
   - Non-nullity of critical components

4. Use `&&` for simple conjunctions and `&&&` for more complex ones

5. For circular data structures, think about how the head/tail pointers relate to each other

6. Include range checks when appropriate (e.g., indices must be less than length)


# Verus Match Syntax Guidelines

## Using `matches!` Macro

In Verus, the `matches!` macro must use Rust's standard macro syntax:

```rust
// CORRECT
pub open spec fn is_Some<A>(opt: MyOption<A>) -> bool {
    matches!(opt, MyOption::Some(_))
}

// INCORRECT - don't use this syntax
pub open spec fn is_Some<A>(opt: MyOption<A>) -> bool {
    matches opt {
        MyOption::Some(_) => true,
        MyOption::None => false,
    }
}
```

## Match with `arbitrary()` in Spec Functions

When writing spec functions that match on patterns with impossible/unreachable branches, use `arbitrary()` instead of `unreachable!()`:

```rust
// CORRECT
pub open spec fn get_Some_0<A>(opt: MyOption<A>) -> A
    recommends is_Some(opt)
{
    match opt {
        MyOption::Some(a) => a,
        MyOption::None => arbitrary(), // For unreachable branches in spec functions
    }
}

// INCORRECT
pub open spec fn get_Some_0<A>(opt: MyOption<A>) -> A
    recommends is_Some(opt)
{
    match opt {
        MyOption::Some(a) => a,
        MyOption::None => unreachable!(), // Don't use this in spec functions
    }
}
```

## Match in Executable Functions

For unreachable branches in executable functions, use `unreached()`:

```rust
pub fn unwrap(self) -> (a: A)
    requires
        is_Some(self),
    ensures
        a == get_Some_0(self),
{
    match self {
        MyOption::Some(a) => a,
        MyOption::None => unreached(), // For unreachable branches in exec functions
    }
}
```

## Match in Proof Functions

For unreachable branches in proof functions, use `proof_from_false()`:

```rust
pub proof fn tracked_unwrap(tracked self) -> (tracked a: A)
    requires
        is_Some(self),
    ensures
        a == get_Some_0(self),
{
    match self {
        MyOption::Some(a) => a,
        MyOption::None => proof_from_false(), // For unreachable branches in proof functions
    }
}
```


# Verus Sequence Knowledge

Seq<T> is a mathematical sequence type used in specifications:

- Building: Seq::empty(), seq![x, y, z], Seq::singleton(x)
- Length: s.len()
- Indexing: s[i] (0-based)
- Subrange: s.subrange(lo, hi) gives elements from index lo (inclusive) to hi (exclusive)
- Concatenation: s1 + s2
- Update: s.update(i, v) returns a new sequence with index i updated to value v
- Contains: s.contains(v) checks if v is in the sequence
- Push/pop: s.push(v), s.pop() (returns new sequence, doesn't modify original)
- Equality: Use `=~=` for sequence equality, NOT `==` (e.g., `seq1 =~= seq2`, `self@.0 =~= old(self)@.0.subrange(1, (old(self)@.0.len()) as int)`)

You can use forall or exists for properties over sequences.

## CRITICAL: Postconditions for Seq<T> Update Operations

**For functions that update a single element in a sequence-based view**:

**✅ PREFER** - Use `.update()` for succinct, provable specifications:
```rust
fn update_element(&mut self, idx: usize, value: T)
    requires
        idx < old(self)@.len(),
    ensures
        self@ == old(self)@.update(idx as int, value),  // ✅ Succinct!
```

**❌ AVOID** - Verbose element-wise specifications (makes proofs much harder):
```rust
ensures
    self@.len() == old(self)@.len(),
    forall|i: int| 0 <= i && i < self@.len() && i != idx as int ==> self@[i] == old(self)@[i],
    self@[idx as int] == value,
```

**Why `.update()` is better**:
1. More concise and readable
2. Directly matches proof patterns (pairs with `assert_seqs_equal!`)
3. Easier for Verus SMT solver to reason about
4. Standard pattern in Verus for sequence modifications

**When to use this pattern**:
- Any function that modifies exactly one position in a Seq-based view
- After operations that update a single element (e.g., `self.data.set(index, value)`)
- Functions with postconditions about changing one element while preserving others

## Subrange Usage

1. Cast indices to `int`: `self.head as int`, not just `self.head`
2. Use `.subrange(start, end)`, not `seq[start..end]`
3. Wrap complex expressions: `(..).subrange((expression) as int, ...)`
4. For full length: `(sequence.len()) as int`

## verification_plan

Current State:
- The RingBuffer<T> struct explicitly implements the "View" trait but lacks a corresponding view specification.
- There are placeholder TODOs for type invariants, function specifications (requires/ensures), and proofs.
- The struct has a #[verifier::type_invariant] annotation indicating a need for invariants.

Dependencies:
- The RingBuffer<T> type_invariant depends on a correct View function for the data structure.
- Each RingBuffer<T> method’s proof depends on corresponding function specifications and invariants.

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
The code contains an explicit "impl View" block for the RingBuffer<T> struct, which triggers the requirement for view_inference and view_refinement steps. Since RingBuffer<T> is a struct with a type_invariant, the inv_inference step is also applicable. Finally, there are several "TODO: add proof" markers, which necessitate proof_generation at the end.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – RingBuffer<T> is a struct with #[verifier::type_invariant].
- proof_generation: Yes – "TODO: add proof" exists in the code.
