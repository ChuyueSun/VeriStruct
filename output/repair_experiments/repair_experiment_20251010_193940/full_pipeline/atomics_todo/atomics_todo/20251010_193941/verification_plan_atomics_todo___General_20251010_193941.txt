## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a Lock<T> struct which uses an AtomicBool and has a “TODO: add specification” for its well_formed function.
- The take<T> function has “TODO: add requires and ensures” plus “TODO: add invariants” for its loop.
- The code also defines a VEqualG struct with a “TODO: add specification” inside atomic_inv.
- Thus, both type invariants and function specifications are partially missing, and there is also a loop that needs invariants.

Dependencies:
- The Lock<T> data structure’s well_formed invariant is essential for the take<T> function.
- The VEqualG predicate relies on an atomic invariant that must match the ghost and concrete state for operations on AtomicU64.
- Proofs for the loop invariants in take<T> will depend on the Lock<T> invariants and any newly inferred specifications.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
- The code contains a struct (Lock<T>) which needs type invariants.
- There are placeholders to add requires/ensures for the take<T> function, indicating specification is needed.
- There is no mention of implementing or refining a View function, so the Full Sequence Workflow is not required.

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference
3. proof_generation  ← Appended because the code has "TODO: add invariants"

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – Lock<T> is a data structure that needs invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes – "TODO: add invariants" triggers final proof_generation step.
