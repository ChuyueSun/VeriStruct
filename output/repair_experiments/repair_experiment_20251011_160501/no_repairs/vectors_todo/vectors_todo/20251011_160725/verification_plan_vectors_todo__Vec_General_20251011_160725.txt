## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code includes functions (binary_search, reverse, binary_search_no_spinoff) with “TODO: add specification” markers.
- There are also “TODO: add invariants” markers, but these refer to loop invariants rather than type invariants for a user-defined struct/class.
- No user-defined data structures are present that require their own type invariants or View functions.
- No references to “View” or “implement View” exist in the code.

Dependencies:
- The functions depend on standard library types (Vec<u64>), but there is no custom struct or class demanding type invariants.
- The specification requirements are localized to the three functions listed.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
There are no user-defined data structures requiring type invariants, so inv_inference does not apply. The code does not reference or require a View abstraction. However, the code does have placeholders for function specifications (“TODO: add specification”), making spec_inference the correct approach. Loop invariants do not necessitate the inv_inference module since they are not type invariants, but the presence of “TODO: add invariants” indicates a final proof_generation step for those loops.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference
2. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No – there is no class/struct data structure requiring type invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes – “TODO: add invariants” is present, triggering final proof generation.
