## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a struct VecSet with a view() function returning a Set<u64>.
- Multiple "TODO" markers are present: "TODO: add requires and ensures", "TODO: add proof", and "TODO: add invariant".
- The data structure methods (new, insert, contains) lack specification clauses.

Dependencies:
- The VecSet::view() function must correctly reflect the abstract mathematical set of values.
- The insert and contains methods rely on VecSet's internal vector state and must align with the view() abstraction.
- The for-loop invariant in contains is necessary for loop correctness and must relate to the VecSet’s view.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
- A "view" function is explicitly defined in the struct (pub closed spec fn view), indicating a need for View inference and refinement.
- The code is a struct-based data structure (VecSet), so inv_inference is also applicable.
- The presence of “TODO: add requires and ensures” confirms a need for spec_inference.
- Because “TODO: add proof”/“TODO: add invariant” is present, proof_generation will be added at the end.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes (VecSet is a struct data structure)
- proof_generation: Yes (“TODO: add proof” and “TODO: add invariants” present)
```
