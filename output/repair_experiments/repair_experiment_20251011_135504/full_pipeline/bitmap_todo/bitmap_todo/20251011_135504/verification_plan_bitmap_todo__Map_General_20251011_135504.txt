## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The BitMap struct requires a spec-level “view” function but it is not yet implemented ("TODO: implement view").
- Several methods (e.g., from, get_bit, set_bit, or) are missing requires/ensures clauses.
- There are “TODO: add proof” placeholders in set_bit (and possibly other functions), indicating proof obligations remain unfinished.

Dependencies:
- The BitMap::view function depends on properly translating the internal bits array into a Seq<bool>.
- The methods from, get_bit, set_bit, and or depend on correctly specified pre-/post-conditions.
- Proof steps rely on the macros (get_bit64, set_bit64) and the overall struct’s invariants.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
The code explicitly contains a "view" function for the BitMap struct ("TODO: implement view"). This triggers the Full Sequence Workflow since a View implementation is clearly required. Furthermore, BitMap is a struct, so including the inv_inference step is appropriate. The presence of “TODO: add requires/ensures” aligns with specifying function contracts, and “TODO: add proof” necessitates a final proof_generation step.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes (BitMap is a struct; likely needs type invariants).
- proof_generation: Yes (code contains “TODO: add proof”).
