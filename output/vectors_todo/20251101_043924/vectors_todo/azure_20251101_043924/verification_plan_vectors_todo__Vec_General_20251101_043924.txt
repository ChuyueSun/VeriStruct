## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code consists of three top-level functions (binary_search, reverse, binary_search_no_spinoff) that operate on a standard library vector (Vec<u64>).
- There is no user-defined struct or class requiring type invariants.
- Each function has a "TODO: add specification" marker indicating missing requires/ensures clauses.
- There are also "TODO: add invariants" markers, but they refer to loop invariants rather than type invariants.

Dependencies:
- The binary_search and binary_search_no_spinoff functions both require that the vector passed in is sorted (loop invariants and functional specifications needed).
- The reverse function needs functional specifications detailing the reversal property on the vector.
- No data-structure-level invariant dependencies exist (no user-defined struct/class).

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
- The code does not define any class/struct data structure. Therefore, no type invariants are needed.
- There is no mention of "View" functions or references requiring a full sequence workflow.
- The primary need is function-level requires/ensures (i.e., specifications), fulfilling the "TODO: add specification" placeholders.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference
2. proof_generation  (added because there is a "TODO: add invariants" marker)

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No – there is no user-defined class or struct.
- proof_generation: Yes – the code contains "TODO: add invariants," which triggers a final proof_generation step.
