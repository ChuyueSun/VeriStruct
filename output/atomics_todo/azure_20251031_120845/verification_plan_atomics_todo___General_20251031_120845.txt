Current State:
- The code defines a struct Lock<T> which qualifies as a data structure needing invariants.
- There are explicit TODOs for function specifications: "TODO: add requires and ensures" and "TODO: add specification".
- There is also a "TODO: add invariants" marker.
- No usage or mention of a View function or "TODO: add View" is present.

Dependencies:
- The Lock<T> struct must maintain an invariant that field: AtomicBool matches an Option<T> in a well-formed way.
- The take function relies on a well-formed Lock<T> and needs loop invariants and function specs.

**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
The code has a class/struct data structure (Lock<T>) needing invariants and also needs function specifications (“TODO: add requires and ensures”). There is no mention of any View function or "TODO: add View," so a Full Sequence Workflow is not required. The presence of both invariants and specs directs us to the Invariant-First Workflow.

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference
3. proof_generation  <-- Included because of "TODO: add invariants" in the code

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes - Lock<T> is a struct requiring an invariant.
- proof_generation: Yes - "TODO: add invariants" triggers proof_generation.
