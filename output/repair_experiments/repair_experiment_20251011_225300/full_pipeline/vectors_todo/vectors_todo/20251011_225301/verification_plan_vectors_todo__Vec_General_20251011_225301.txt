## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code consists of three functions (binary_search, reverse, binary_search_no_spinoff) each containing “TODO: add specification” and “TODO: add invariants” comments.
- There are no custom data structures (no structs/classes) that would require type invariants or View functions.

Identified Missing Components:
- The functions require complete Verus specifications (requires/ensures clauses).
- The while/for loops need loop invariants.

Critical Verification Challenges:
- Ensuring function correctness specifications (pre/post conditions).
- Providing proper loop invariants for verification of loops in binary_search, reverse, and binary_search_no_spinoff.

Dependencies:
- All three functions rely on proper specification of preconditions, postconditions, and loop invariants for verification.
- No custom data structure or View implementation is needed, so there are no data-structure-level dependencies.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
There are no custom data structures in this code, so type invariants and View functions are not required. However, the functions each contain "TODO: add specification" placeholders, indicating we only need to provide requires and ensures clauses. The presence of “TODO: add invariants” does not indicate a need for type invariants—instead, it concerns loop invariants, so we remain in the Specification-Only workflow. Nonetheless, the “TODO: add invariants” prompts the addition of the proof_generation step at the end.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference
2. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No (no class/struct data structure is present).
- proof_generation: Yes (due to the “TODO: add invariants” markers in the code).
