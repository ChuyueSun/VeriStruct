Current State:
- The code includes a struct "RingBuffer" that has a TODO for a View implementation.
- There are multiple TODOs about adding specifications (requires/ensures) and proofs for various methods.
- The code also contains a type invariant placeholder for the "RingBuffer" struct.
- Several methods (e.g., len, has_elements, is_full, new, enqueue, dequeue, available_len) need specifications.
- The code explicitly mentions "View" within the "impl<T: Copy> View for RingBuffer<T>" block.

Dependencies:
- The "RingBuffer" struct must provide its mathematical View function.
- The "RingBuffer" struct relies on an invariant function ("inv") to maintain internal consistency.
- Specifications for each public method depend on the type invariant and the View function.
- Proof blocks need to cite both the invariants and the function specifications to show correctness.

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
The code explicitly contains a "View" implementation requirement for the "RingBuffer" struct. Therefore, it needs a complete verification strategy including the derivation and refinement of a View function. Since the code also includes a struct that requires an invariant and specification, the Full Sequence Workflow with inv_inference is appropriate. Moreover, multiple functions contain "TODO: add proof," so a proof_generation step is also needed.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes - the code has a "RingBuffer" struct requiring a type invariant.
- proof_generation: Yes - the code explicitly contains "TODO: add proof" placeholders.
