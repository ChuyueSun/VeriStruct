## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code has a struct "FixedParity" but the key RwLockPredicate::inv function is missing its specification (marked with "TODO: add specification").
- The RwLock uses that predicate, and thus the code cannot be fully verified until the struct’s invariant and function specification are provided.

Dependencies:
- The struct "FixedParity" and its inv function under RwLockPredicate.
- The RwLock data structure depends on the correctness of the specification for "FixedParity::inv".

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
The code contains a struct ("FixedParity") that requires type invariants and also includes a "TODO: add specification" placeholder. There is no indication of needing a dedicated "View" for this struct, so the Invariant-First Workflow is appropriate.

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – the struct "FixedParity" needs an invariant function.
- proof_generation: No – there is no "TODO: add proof" or "TODO: add invariants" marker.
```
