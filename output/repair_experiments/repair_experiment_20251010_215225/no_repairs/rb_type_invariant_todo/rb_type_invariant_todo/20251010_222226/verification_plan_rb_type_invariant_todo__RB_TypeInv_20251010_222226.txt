## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a struct "RingBuffer<T>" and an associated "inv" function marked with #[verifier::type_invariant].
- The code implements the trait "View" for RingBuffer, with a placeholder "TODO: add specification."
- Multiple methods in "RingBuffer" have "TODO: add requires and ensures" and "TODO: add proof."
- No explicit compile-time error details are given, but the code is missing the necessary specification and proof annotations.
- Because "View" is explicitly referenced, the code requires a complete verification approach with both View inference and refinement.

Dependencies:
- The "RingBuffer" struct depends on a correct "View" implementation to define its abstract representation.
- The "inv" function must align with the ring buffer's structural invariants and is used for type checking (#[verifier::type_invariant]).
- The ring buffer's methods (enqueue, dequeue, etc.) depend on correct requires/ensures clauses and corresponding proofs.
- Multiple "TODO: add proof" placeholders require a final proof-generation step.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
Since the code explicitly uses "View" ("impl<T: Copy> View for RingBuffer<T>") and has "TODO: add specification" for that View, we require a complete verification, which is provided by the Full Sequence Workflow. Additionally, "RingBuffer" is a struct with a type invariant, so we include the inv_inference step. Finally, there are "TODO: add proof" markers, so we append the proof_generation step.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – "RingBuffer<T>" is a struct with a #[verifier::type_invariant].
- proof_generation: Yes – "TODO: add proof" placeholders appear in multiple methods.
