## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a struct "FixedParity" implementing the RwLockPredicate<u64> trait, but its inv(...) function is left with a "TODO: add specification" placeholder.
- This indicates missing specification details for the struct.
- There is no mention of a custom "View" requirement.

Dependencies:
- The RwLock uses the FixedParity::inv(...) function to enforce its invariant.
- Proper specifications (requires/ensures) are needed in FixedParity::inv(...) to complete verification.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
We have a struct data structure (FixedParity) and a "TODO: add specification" placeholder in its inv function. There is no explicit "View" keyword or any requirement for implementing a View function. Hence the code qualifies for the Invariant-First Workflow, which includes generating and refining invariants followed by specification inference.

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes (FixedParity is a struct requiring an invariant)
- proof_generation: No (no "TODO: add proof" or "TODO: add invariants" markers are present)
```
