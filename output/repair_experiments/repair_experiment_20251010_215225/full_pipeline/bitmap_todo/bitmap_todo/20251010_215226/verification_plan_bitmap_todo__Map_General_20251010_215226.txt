Current State:
- There is a struct BitMap with a “TODO: implement view” indicating a View function is explicitly required
- Multiple functions (from, get_bit, set_bit, or) lack requires/ensures specifications
- “TODO: add proof” blocks are present, requiring formal proof bodies
- A loop in or() also has a “TODO: add loop invariant”

Dependencies:
- The BitMap struct’s mathematical abstraction depends on the “view” function
- Functions set_bit and or depend on proof obligations to verify bitwise correctness
- Loop correctness in or() depends on a proper loop invariant

```

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
The code explicitly requires a View function (“spec fn view(&self)”) with “TODO: implement view” and includes a struct BitMap, necessitating complete verification. Because it is a struct, we include inv_inference, then we finalize with spec_inference. There are also “TODO: add proof” markers, so proof_generation must be added as a final step.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – a struct BitMap is present, potentially requiring invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes – “TODO: add proof” blocks appear in the code.
