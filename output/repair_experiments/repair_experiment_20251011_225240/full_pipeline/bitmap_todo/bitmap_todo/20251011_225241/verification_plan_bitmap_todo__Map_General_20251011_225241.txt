Current State:
- The code defines a struct BitMap with a spec fn view explicitly marked as a TODO.
- There are multiple TODO placeholders for requires/ensures clauses, invariants, and proofs.
- The presence of “TODO: implement view” indicates an explicit View requirement.
- Since BitMap is a struct, it qualifies for invariants as well.

Dependencies:
- The BitMap::view function’s correctness depends on providing the proper abstraction of the bits field.
- Each method (from, get_bit, set_bit, or) depends on an accurate and consistent specification of view.
- Proof obligations rely on the final verified specification and invariants.

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
A struct BitMap is present, so it qualifies for type invariants. The code explicitly contains “TODO: implement view,” indicating a View function requirement. There are also specification and proof TODOs. Hence, the Full Sequence Workflow is appropriate.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – BitMap is a struct requiring potential invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes – “TODO: add proof” placeholders are present.
```
