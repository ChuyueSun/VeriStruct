## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a struct "FixedParity" that implements "RwLockPredicate<u64>," but its "inv" function is missing a specification (marked with "TODO: add specification").
- There is no mention of any "View" function or "TODO: add View."
- The code is a data-structure-based implementation (for a reader-writer lock), indicating potential need for type invariants or function specifications.

Dependencies:
- The "FixedParity" struct’s invariant function must align with the lock’s correctness properties.
- The function-level specification ("inv") depends on how the parity constraint is established.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
- The code contains a struct data structure ("FixedParity") that requires a type-level invariant.
- A "TODO: add specification" placeholder indicates some function specification is needed.
- There is no explicit reference to "View" or "TODO: add View," so the Full Sequence Workflow is not required.

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – the input is a struct requiring a type-level invariant for "FixedParity."
- proof_generation: No – there is no "TODO: add proof" marker in the code.
