Current State:
- The code defines an enum MyOption with several functions marked "TODO: add specification" or "TODO: add requires and ensures."
- There is no mention of any type invariants or “View” implementation.
- No "TODO: add proof" or "TODO: add invariants" appear in the code.

Dependencies:
- The functions or, is_some, is_none, as_ref, unwrap, etc. depend on properly specifying requires/ensures clauses.
- No additional dependencies requiring invariants or View refinement were found.
```

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
All “TODO” markers relate solely to specifying function contracts (requires/ensures). There is no mention of “View” or invariants. Hence, the code only needs the spec_inference step.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No – the enum MyOption does not require any type invariants.
- proof_generation: No – there are no "TODO: add proof" or "TODO: add invariants" markers.
```
