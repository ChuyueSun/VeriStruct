## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines two struct data structures (Node and TreeMap) which implement and maintain BST invariants.
- There is an explicit “View” trait implementation (with a “TODO: add specification” placeholder).
- Multiple “TODO: add requires/ensures” markers appear in the code.
- A “TODO: add proof” placeholder appears, indicating additional proof obligations are needed.

Identified Missing Components:
- The TreeMap “as_map” function lacks its specification body.
- The “view” function in the View trait implementation needs a spec body.
- Various functions (new, insert, delete, get, etc.) have missing requires/ensures clauses.
- Proof obligations (e.g., establishing well-formedness or type invariants) remain unfilled.

Critical Verification Challenges:
- Verifying correctness of BST insert/delete while ensuring well-formedness.
- Providing the View definition aligning with the Node/TreeMap data structure.
- Ensuring that requires/ensures and additional proofs cover BST invariants and usage.

Dependencies:
- The TreeMap and Node data structures depend on their well_formed invariants.
- The “View” trait implementation depends on the correct “as_map” specification.
- Functions requiring well-formedness (e.g., insert, delete) depend on the type_invariant.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
The code explicitly contains a “View” implementation (via the “impl<V> View for TreeMap<V>”). Since the “View” trait is used and the code includes “TODO: add specification” in the “view” function, this requires a full sequence approach. Additionally, because we have struct data structures (Node, TreeMap), the “inv_inference” step is included.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation  ← (appended because “TODO: add proof” placeholders are present)

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes — we have a struct data structure (TreeMap and Node) and a type_invariant.
- proof_generation: Yes — one or more “TODO: add proof” markers appear in the code.
```
