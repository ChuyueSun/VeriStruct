Current State:
- The code explicitly implements the "View" trait for TreeMap, indicating a need for a full view-based approach.
- Several "TODO" markers are present for specifications (requires/ensures) and proofs.
- The code defines struct Node and struct TreeMap, both of which form a BST data structure with a type invariant.

Dependencies:
- TreeMap::as_map depends on Node::optional_as_map for the final map representation.
- well_formed methods in Node and TreeMap depend on each other to ensure BST properties.
- The View trait implementation for TreeMap relies on an appropriate view function that returns a Map<u64, V>.
- Insert/Delete/Get operations depend on BST invariants and map equivalences.

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
This code explicitly contains a "View" implementation (the "impl<V> View for TreeMap<V>" block), requiring view-based verification. It also has type invariants for a struct. Therefore, the Full Sequence Workflow is warranted. Since we have a struct data structure (TreeMap and Node), we include inv_inference as needed.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes - because the code defines struct Node and struct TreeMap and uses a type invariant to capture BST properties.
- proof_generation: Yes - because there are multiple "TODO: add proof" markers in the code.
