Current State:
- The BitMap struct requires a View function (“spec fn view”) but is not yet implemented.
- Multiple methods (from, get_bit, set_bit, or) need requires/ensures specifications.
- Several places have “TODO: add proof” indicating needed proof blocks.
- There's also a “TODO: add loop invariant” in the while loop inside or().
- Struct-based data structure + explicit “View” implementation requirement + specification placeholders + proof placeholders.

Dependencies:
- The BitMap struct’s “view” method (View function) underpins formal reasoning about correctness of get_bit/set_bit/or methods.
- Invariance conditions must be tied to correctness of internal bits representation.
- Spec (requires/ensures) must link to verifying correct usage of indices and preserving the overall bit properties.
- Final proofs will rely on the newly inferred invariants and specifications.

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
The code explicitly contains a “spec fn view” for the BitMap struct and has “TODO: implement view.” This directly requires implementing a View function, triggering the Full Sequence Workflow. Moreover, it is a class/struct data structure with to-be-inferred invariants, along with requires/ensures placeholders and proof placeholders.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – input is a struct (BitMap) needing type invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes – there are “TODO: add proof” markers in the code.
