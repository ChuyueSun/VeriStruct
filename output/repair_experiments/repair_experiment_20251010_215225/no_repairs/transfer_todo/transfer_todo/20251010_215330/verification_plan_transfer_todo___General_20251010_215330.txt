Current State:
- The function "transfer" lacks the necessary pre- and postconditions ("TODO: add requires and ensures")
- No invariants are explicitly requested for the struct "Account"
- There is no mention of or need for a View function

Dependencies:
- The "transfer" function depends on correct specification of its requires/ensures clauses
- The struct "Account" itself does not appear to require an invariant beyond the built-in property of u64

```

```markdown
**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
No "View" implementation or View-related TODO is indicated. While there is a struct "Account," no invariant-related TODO appears, so we do not need to generate type invariants. The primary missing elements are the requires and ensures clauses for the "transfer" function.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No – the struct does not explicitly require additional type invariants.
- proof_generation: No – there are no "TODO: add proof" markers in the code.
```
