Current State:
- A RingBuffer data structure is defined with a placeholder View implementation ("impl<T: Copy> View for RingBuffer<T>"), indicating that a View function is indeed required.
- There are also placeholders ("TODO: add requires and ensures" and "TODO: add proof") for each of the methods in the RingBuffer.
- A type_invariant stub exists but no invariant body has been added.
- Overall, multiple verification components are missing (View definition, type invariants, specifications, and proofs).

Dependencies:
- The ring buffer’s methods depend on a valid View definition, type invariants, and function specifications for correctness.
- Proof blocks (“TODO: add proof”) must rely on completed specifications and invariants to discharge verification conditions.

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
The code explicitly declares "impl<T: Copy> View for RingBuffer<T>" and contains "TODO: add specification" regarding the View. This means a View function is required. Additionally, the code includes a struct needing type invariants and function specifications. Hence, the Full Sequence Workflow best addresses all these needs.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes - because RingBuffer is a struct requiring invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes - "TODO: add proof" markers are present in the code.
