## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a simple Account struct but does not mention any invariants for it.
- The transfer function has a "TODO: add requires and ensures" placeholder, indicating the need for function specifications.
- No references to “View” or view-related abstractions appear.
- No requests or placeholders for proofs or invariants.

Dependencies:
- The transfer function depends on having valid preconditions/ensures clauses to avoid underflow/overflow.
- No additional constraints or invariants appear necessary for the Account struct.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
There are specification placeholders ("TODO: add requires and ensures") and no mention of needing invariants on the Account struct. There is also no mention of “View” or view-related functionality, so we do not need to generate or refine a View. Thus, the Specification-Only Workflow is sufficient.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No (no invariants requested for the Account struct)
- proof_generation: No ("TODO: add proof" is not present)
```
