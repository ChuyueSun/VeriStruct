Current State:
- The code includes a struct BitMap with an unfinished "spec fn view" indicating a required View implementation.
- There are multiple "TODO: add requires and ensures" placeholders in the methods (from, get_bit, set_bit, or), indicating the need for function specifications.
- There is a "TODO: add proof" comment in set_bit, indicating proof obligations still need to be filled.
- Therefore, a complete verification sequence is required (including the View steps), along with invariant generation (since BitMap is a struct) and final proofs.

Dependencies:
- The BitMap’s view function depends on correctly deriving the boolean sequence from the internal bits vector.
- Invariants may be needed to ensure consistency between the number of bits requested and the length of the internal vector.
- The proof of set_bit relies on the correctness of get_bit64!/set_bit64! macros and the invariants/specs of BitMap.

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
This code explicitly contains a “spec fn view” that needs implementation, which triggers the requirement for a View-based workflow. It also includes a struct (BitMap) that likely needs type invariants, and there are several specification todos indicating function specs are needed. Finally, a "TODO: add proof" is present, so proof_generation will be appended.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – BitMap is a struct data structure requiring invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes – “TODO: add proof” is present in set_bit.
```
