Current State:
- The TreeMap and Node structs are partially specified; several functions lack requires/ensures clauses.
- The "View" trait is implemented for TreeMap, but the view() function is incomplete.
- Multiple “TODO” markers exist for adding specifications and proofs (e.g., “// TODO: add specification” and “// TODO: add proof”).
- The BST property is maintained via a type_invariant, but function specifications are incomplete.

Dependencies:
- The TreeMap’s as_map relies on Node’s optional_as_map and as_map for correctness.
- The well_formed invariant in TreeMap depends on Node’s well_formed logic.
- The insert/delete/get implementations depend on this well_formed invariant to maintain BST properties.
- The “View” implementation for TreeMap depends on the as_map logic from Node.

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
The code explicitly includes a “View” implementation for TreeMap and contains TODO markers for specification and proof. Since there are struct data structures (Node and TreeMap) and a required “View,” the Full Sequence Workflow is applicable. Furthermore, inv_inference applies due to the presence of data structures with invariants.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes (TreeMap and Node are struct data types requiring invariants)
- proof_generation: Yes (due to “TODO: add proof” markers)
```
