## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a RingBuffer<T> struct with a "View" trait implementation stub, indicating a need for a View function.
- Multiple "TODO" markers request adding specifications, proofs, and invariants to the RingBuffer methods, so the code is incomplete in several verification aspects.
- No requires/ensures are present for critical methods, and the View is not implemented.
- The code references type_invariant and also has placeholders for proofs.

Dependencies:
- The RingBuffer<T> depends on a complete View specification and type_invariant for correctness.
- Each ring buffer method depends on having appropriate requires/ensures clauses and potentially uses the ring buffer invariant.
- The placeholders to "add proof" rely on correct specifications (requires/ensures, invariants, and the View).

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
- The RingBuffer<T> is a struct, which suggests we may need invariants.
- There is a direct requirement for a "View" implementation ("impl<T: Copy> View for RingBuffer<T>") along with "TODO: add specification" for that View.
- Hence, we must generate and refine the View (view_inference → view_refinement), then add invariants and specifications.
- Multiple methods require "TODO: add proof," so we will also add a final proof_generation step.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes — RingBuffer<T> is a struct requiring a type invariant.
- proof_generation: Yes — "TODO: add proof" markers appear throughout the ring buffer methods.
