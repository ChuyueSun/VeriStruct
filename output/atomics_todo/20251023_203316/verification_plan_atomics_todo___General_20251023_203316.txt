Current State:
- The code defines a Lock<T> struct requiring an invariant between the AtomicBool and the Option<T>.
- Multiple specification placeholders appear: "TODO: add specification" in well_formed, "TODO: add requires and ensures" in take, and "TODO: add invariants" in the take loop.
- Another placeholder exists in VEqualG ("TODO: add specification").
- No explicit request for a dedicated "View" function is present.
- A class/struct data structure ("Lock<T>") is present and needs invariants.

Dependencies:
- The Lock<T> data structure’s invariants depend on connecting field: AtomicBool with Option<T>.
- The take function’s correctness depends on the lock invariant and newly added requires/ensures conditions.
- The VEqualG predicate must maintain consistent atomic_inv specification.

**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
We have a class/struct data structure Lock<T> that needs type invariants. There are also "TODO: add requires/ensures" placeholders for the take function, indicating specifications are needed too. No explicit "View" implementation is requested, so we do not perform the Full Sequence Workflow.

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference
3. proof_generation  (appended because the code has a "TODO: add invariants")

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – Lock<T> is a struct needing invariant definitions.
- proof_generation: Yes – "TODO: add invariants" triggers proof generation.
```
