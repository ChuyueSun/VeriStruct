## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a RingBuffer<T> struct requiring a View implementation.
- It includes a type_invariant ("inv") but does not implement the body for either the View or the invariant.
- Various methods reference the ring buffer’s fields (head, tail, ring) but are missing comprehensive specifications.

Identified Missing Components:
- A proper View function for RingBuffer<T> (since "TODO: implement this" in the View impl).
- A complete specification of the ring buffer’s invariants (the inv function is left unimplemented).
- Possibly refined specifications for public methods (len, has_elements, is_full, etc.).

Critical Verification Challenges:
- Ensuring the ring buffer’s type invariants hold (the ring buffer’s head/tail usage must be internally consistent).
- Relating the ring buffer’s ring-field to its abstract mathematical View.

Dependencies:
- The RingBuffer<T> struct is closely tied to a View implementation as well as a type_invariant.
- Correctness of enqueue/dequeue logic depends on the ring buffer’s type invariant and the eventual View abstraction.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
This code explicitly declares "impl<T: Copy> View for RingBuffer<T>" and contains a "TODO: implement this" for the View. Furthermore, the RingBuffer is a struct with a type-invariant. Hence, we apply the Full Sequence Workflow consisting of view_inference → view_refinement → inv_inference → spec_inference to properly establish its View abstraction and refine it before finalizing the invariants and specifications.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes, because RingBuffer<T> is a struct and has a type_invariant.
- proof_generation: No, there is no "TODO: add proof" or "TODO: add invariants" present.
