Current State:
- The Lock<T> struct requires a type invariant, but its well_formed function is missing the required invariant body (“TODO: add specification”).
- The take function also needs loop invariants as well as requires/ensures clauses.
- The VEqualG struct requires a specification for the atomic_inv function.
- Overall, both invariants and specifications are missing in multiple places, and there are “TODO: add invariants” markers indicating the need for a proof.

Dependencies:
- The Lock<T> struct’s correct use in take depends on the invariant in well_formed.
- The loop invariants in take depend on the correctness of the data type invariants in Lock<T>.
- The VEqualG trait’s atomic_inv specification impacts atomic operations in test.

**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
There is a struct (Lock<T>) that needs a type invariant, plus the take function has a “TODO: add requires and ensures”, so both invariants and function specs must be inferred. There is no explicit “View” implementation requirement, so the Full Sequence Workflow is not needed.

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference
3. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – the Lock<T> struct requires an invariant.
- proof_generation: Yes – “TODO: add invariants” is present, so we generate proofs at the end.
