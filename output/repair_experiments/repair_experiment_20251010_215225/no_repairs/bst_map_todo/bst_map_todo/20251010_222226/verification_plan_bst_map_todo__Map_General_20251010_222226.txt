## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The TreeMap code is a structured data type (a BST) with a “View” trait implementation that uses a map abstraction.
- Several “TODO” markers exist for adding specifications (requires/ensures) and proofs, and the code explicitly includes a “View” for TreeMap.
- The type invariant “well_formed” is already defined, but function-level specifications and proofs still need completion.

Identified Missing Components:
- Complete specifications for as_map and view functions per the “TODO: add specification” markers.
- Requires/ensures clauses for multiple methods (e.g., new, insert, delete, get, etc.).
- Proof blocks for verification of invariants (there is a “TODO: add proof” marker).

Critical Verification Challenges:
- Ensuring correctness of the BST invariant (keys on left < node.key < keys on right) at every insertion/deletion step.
- Incorporating the “View” trait and ensuring it reflects the underlying map abstraction accurately.

Dependencies:
- The TreeMap’s correctness depends on the Node’s BST invariant.
- The “as_map” and “view” basically unify the structure’s representation as a Map<u64, V>.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
The code explicitly implements the “View” trait and defines a “view” function that must return a map abstraction. Therefore, it meets the requirement for the Full Sequence Workflow (the presence of a View implementation). Since it is a struct-based BST and has explicit “TODO: add proof” markers, we also include the inv_inference step and conclude with proof_generation.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – There is a TreeMap struct and a corresponding BST invariant that needs verification.
- proof_generation: Yes – A “TODO: add proof” marker is present in the insert method, necessitating final proof generation.
