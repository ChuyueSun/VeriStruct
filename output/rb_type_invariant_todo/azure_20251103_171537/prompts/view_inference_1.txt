You are an expert in Verus (verifier for rust). Your task is to generate a View function for the given module.

The View is the mathematical abstraction of a data structure - it captures the ESSENTIAL LOGICAL STATE,
not just the implementation details.

**STEP 1: Identify the Data Structure's Purpose**

Ask yourself: What does this structure represent logically?
- A collection of elements? → Likely Seq<T>, Set<T>, or Map<K,V>
- A value with constraints? → Might need tuple to track both
- Multiple independent concepts? → Definitely needs tuple

**STEP 2: Count Independent Logical Aspects**

Analyze the struct fields to identify CONCEPTUAL aspects (not just field count):

Example: Counter with fields { value: u64, max: u64 }
- value, max = 2 fields
- Logically:
  * Current value (changes with operations)
  * Maximum allowed (constraint, doesn't change)
- = 2 independent aspects → need 2-tuple: (nat, nat)

Example: Stack with fields { data: Vec<T>, max_capacity: usize }
- data, max_capacity = 2 fields
- Logically:
  * Stack contents (the actual data stored)
  * Capacity limit (maximum size allowed)
- = 2 independent aspects → need 2-tuple: (Seq<T>, nat)

Example: SimpleList with fields { data: Vec<T> }
- data = 1 field
- Logically: just a sequence of elements
- = 1 aspect → simple Seq<T>

Example: Circular structure with fields { storage: Vec<T>, start_index: usize, end_index: usize }
- storage, start_index, end_index = 3 fields
- Logically:
  * The actual content stored (derived from storage + indices together)
  * Total capacity of the storage (fixed property)
- = 2 independent aspects → need 2-tuple: (Seq<T>, usize)

**STEP 3: Choose View Type Based on Analysis**

Single Type (not a tuple):
- Use when the structure represents ONE logical concept
- Examples:
  * List/Array/Vector → Seq<T>
  * Set operations → Set<T>
  * Key-value mapping → Map<K,V>
  * Bitmap → Seq<bool>

Tuple Type (T1, T2):
- Use when the structure has MULTIPLE independent logical aspects
- Common patterns:
  * Content + Capacity: (Seq<T>, nat) or (Seq<T>, usize)
    - When: Structure stores elements with a capacity limit
    - Examples: BoundedStack, bounded buffers/queues
  * Value + Constraint: (nat, nat)
    - When: Tracking a value with a maximum/minimum
    - Examples: BoundedCounter, indices with bounds
  * Data + Metadata: (MainType, MetadataType)
    - When: Primary data plus auxiliary information
    - First element: the main data (Seq, Map, Set, etc.)
    - Second element: size/capacity/constraints/properties

**STEP 4: Implement the View**

Based on your analysis:

```rust
impl<T: Copy> View for StructName<T> {
    type V = // Your chosen type from Step 3

    closed spec fn view(&self) -> Self::V {
        // Implementation that extracts the logical state
        // - For Seq<T>: convert storage to sequence
        // - For tuples: construct tuple with each aspect
        // - Use @ to get spec view of Vec/other types
    }
}
```

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- The View should be SIMPLER than the implementation (abstraction!)
- Fill in only the `/* TODO: part of view */` or empty View trait implementations
- Tuple size should generally be LESS than field count (true abstraction)
- Don't include derivable information (e.g., length can be computed from sequence)
- For `Vec` type variables, use `vec@` to get their Seq<T> view
- Do NOT use `reveal` keyword in the View implementation
- Think about what information is ESSENTIAL for specifications

**REASONING FRAMEWORK:**

Before generating, explicitly consider:
1. "This structure has [N] fields"
2. "Logically, it represents [X] independent concepts"
3. "The essential information is: [list the aspects]"
4. "Therefore, View type should be: [your choice]"

Mathematical types in Verus:
- Scalars: bool, int, nat
- Collections: Seq<T>, Set<T>, Map<K,V>
- Tuples: (T1, T2), (T1, T2, T3), etc.
- Combinations allowed: (Seq<T>, nat), (Map<K,V>, Set<K>), etc.

**CRITICAL: Ensure ALL delimiters are properly balanced:**
- Every opening brace { must have a matching closing brace }
- Every opening parenthesis ( must have a matching closing parenthesis )
- Every opening bracket [ must have a matching closing bracket ]
- Every impl block must be properly closed

# Verus Common Knowledge

## Important Notes
- ALWAYS use parentheses whenever possible for clarity!
- Don't delete existing non-buggy `#[trigger]`!
- Don't change "unwind" to `(unwind) as bool`!
- Return the complete modified Rust code in your response without explanations.
- Keep top level docstrings at the top of the file, before `verus! {`. Do not place them after the `verus! {` declaration.
- Don't change any function signatures.

## Spec Functions
1. No Direct Method Calls:
   In a spec function, you cannot directly call instance methods such as vector.is_full().
2. Use the @ Operator:
   To invoke methods on a variable within a spec, first convert it to its specification-level representation View with @.
3. Always use vector.len() instead of vector@.len().
4. Simplify Boolean Conjunctions:
   When combining multiple conditions, avoid excessive &&&. Fewer (or well-structured) conjunctions make the spec code easier to read and debug.
5. Parentheses Usage:
   ALWAYS wrap conditions in parentheses, even for simple expressions. This makes precedence explicit and prevents errors.

## Proof Blocks - CRITICAL SYNTAX RULES

**🚫 NEVER use executable control flow (if/else/match) inside `proof { }` blocks!**

Proof blocks are spec-level contexts. They can only contain:
- `assert(...)` statements
- `assume(...)` statements
- Lemma/proof function calls
- Variable bindings with spec expressions

❌ **WRONG - Executable if/else in proof:**
```rust
proof {
    if condition { assert(x); } else { assert(y); }  // SYNTAX ERROR!
}
```

✅ **CORRECT - Use implication instead:**
```rust
proof {
    assert(condition ==> x);
    assert(!condition ==> y);
}
```

❌ **WRONG - Executable match in proof:**
```rust
proof {
    match opt { Some(v) => assert(v > 0), None => {} }  // SYNTAX ERROR!
}
```

✅ **CORRECT - Use implication or spec-level reasoning:**
```rust
proof {
    assert(opt.is_Some() ==> opt.unwrap() > 0);
}
```

## Operators
Verus extends Rust logical operators with low-precedence forms that are especially helpful in specification code:

Standard Operators: &&, ||, ==>, <==>
Low-Precedence Variants: &&& and |||

The meaning of &&& is the same as && (logical AND), and ||| is the same as || (logical OR), but with lower precedence. This allows you to write conditions in a "bulleted list" style that remains grouped in a logical manner:

```
&&& a ==> b
&&& c
&&& d <==> e && f
```

is equivalent to:

```
(a ==> b) && c && (d <==> (e && f))
```

Note:
- Implication (==>) and equivalence (<==>) bind more tightly than &&& and |||.
- Using &&&/||| can make long specifications clearer by grouping logical clauses neatly.


# Verus View Function Guidelines

## 🚨 CRITICAL RULE: Check Tuple Size vs Field Count

**If the struct has N fields and the View type is an N-tuple, the view is TRIVIAL and MUST be refined!**

Examples:
  - ❌ TRIVIAL: `struct {ring, head, tail}` → `type V = (Seq<T>, nat, nat)` (3 fields, 3-tuple = NO abstraction)
  - ✅ GOOD: `struct {ring, head, tail}` → `type V = (Seq<T>, nat)` (3 fields, 2-tuple = ABSTRACTION!)
  - ✅ GOOD: `struct {data, len}` → `type V = Seq<T>` (2 fields, single type = ABSTRACTION!)

**Rule:** Tuple size MUST be STRICTLY LESS than field count to show true abstraction!

## View Refinement Guidelines
1. A good View abstraction should:
   - Represent the essential state of the data structure, not just copy its fields
   - Hide implementation details while preserving behavior
   - Be as simple as possible while being complete
   - **Have fewer elements in the tuple than fields in the struct** (or use a single non-tuple type)

2. Common refinements:
   - For collections (arrays, lists): Use Seq<T> instead of raw arrays
   - For indices: Use meaningful representations (e.g., range of valid elements)
   - For flag fields: Consider if they can be derived from other state
   - **Combine related fields into semantic abstractions** (e.g., ring+head+tail → active_elements)

3. Avoid redundancy:
   - Only include fields necessary for specification
   - Derive computable properties in method ensures clauses, not in the view
   - **Don't just wrap every field in a tuple - that's not abstraction!**

4. Prefer mathematical types over concrete types when possible

## verification_plan

Current State:
- The RingBuffer<T> struct explicitly implements the "View" trait but lacks a corresponding view specification.
- There are placeholder TODOs for type invariants, function specifications (requires/ensures), and proofs.
- The struct has a #[verifier::type_invariant] annotation indicating a need for invariants.

Dependencies:
- The RingBuffer<T> type_invariant depends on a correct View function for the data structure.
- Each RingBuffer<T> method’s proof depends on corresponding function specifications and invariants.

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
The code contains an explicit "impl View" block for the RingBuffer<T> struct, which triggers the requirement for view_inference and view_refinement steps. Since RingBuffer<T> is a struct with a type_invariant, the inv_inference step is also applicable. Finally, there are several "TODO: add proof" markers, which necessitate proof_generation at the end.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – RingBuffer<T> is a struct with #[verifier::type_invariant].
- proof_generation: Yes – "TODO: add proof" exists in the code.
