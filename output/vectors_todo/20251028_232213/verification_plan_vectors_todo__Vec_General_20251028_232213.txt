## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code consists of free functions operating on standard library vectors (Vec<u64>) with "TODO: add specification" and "TODO: add invariants" placeholders.
- There is no custom class/struct data structure, so no type invariants or view functions are needed.
- Key verification tasks include adding function requires/ensures clauses and loop invariants.

Dependencies:
- The functions depend on Vec from vstd (standard library).
- Verifications revolve around loop correctness and function postconditions.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
Since there is no custom data structure and no request for a View function, we do not require inv_inference or view_inference. However, the code explicitly has "TODO: add specification" placeholders, which aligns with the Specification-Only Workflow. The presence of "TODO: add invariants" (loop invariants rather than type invariants) triggers an additional proof_generation step at the end.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference
2. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No – the code does not define a custom struct or class.
- proof_generation: Yes – triggered by “TODO: add invariants.”
