Current State:
- The code defines a struct Lock<T> with an AtomicBool field but does not provide its full invariant implementation (“TODO: add specification” for well_formed).
- The function take<T> is missing requires/ensures clauses and loop invariants (“TODO: add requires and ensures” and “TODO: add invariants”).
- There are placeholders requesting both type invariants and function specifications.
- No View-related keywords or TODOs appear in the code.

Dependencies:
- Lock<T> depends on an atomic bool matching the Option<T> state in well_formed.
- The take<T> function’s correctness depends on the lock’s invariants plus its own requires/ensures.
- The loop invariants must ensure correctness of spinning on the atomic compare_exchange.

**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
We have a struct data structure (“Lock<T>”) that needs type invariants and also has placeholders requesting new function specifications (“TODO: add requires and ensures”). There is no explicit mention of a “View” implementation, so Full Sequence Workflow is not required. Therefore, Invariant-First Workflow is most appropriate.

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference
3. proof_generation  ← (appended due to “TODO: add invariants”)

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – the code contains a struct Lock<T> needing invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes – “TODO: add invariants” requires creating proof obligations.
```
