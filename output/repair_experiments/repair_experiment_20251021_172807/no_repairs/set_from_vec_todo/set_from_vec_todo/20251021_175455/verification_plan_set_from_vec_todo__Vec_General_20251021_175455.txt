Current State:
- The code defines a struct VecSet with a Vec<u64> field and a "view" function returning a Set<u64>, but the view function is not fully specified.
- There are multiple TODO placeholders in the methods for requires/ensures, invariants, and proofs.
- The presence of the "view" function explicitly indicates a need for View-related reasoning.

Dependencies:
- VecSet → depends on the Vec<u64> to store elements, and the view function must abstract this into a Set<u64>.
- The methods new, insert, contains → require function contracts (requires/ensures).
- The loop in contains → requires loop invariants.

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
The code explicitly contains a "view" function, indicating the need for a View-based verification. Furthermore, VecSet is a struct data structure, and there are placeholders for both invariants and specifications. Hence, we apply the Full Sequence Workflow. Because there is a struct, we include inv_inference. Additionally, "TODO: add proof" is present, so we append proof_generation at the end.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – VecSet is a struct data structure needing invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes – "TODO: add proof" (and "TODO: add invariant") markers exist.
