### 1. Analysis Summary
```
Current State:
- The code defines a BitMap struct with a spec function "view" (currently a TODO) and several method placeholders (e.g., "from", "get_bit", "set_bit", "or") that lack complete requires/ensures clauses and loop or proof annotations.
- The code uses macros (get_bit64 and set_bit64) and contains explicit "TODO: add proof" markers in methods like "set_bit" and "or", plus a "TODO: implement view" marker.
- There are many specification-level functions and proofs from the vstd library in the same file that provide background lemmas, but the BitMap implementation is not yet fully verified.

Dependencies:
- The BitMap's view function is central, and its correctness underpins the specifications of all methods.
- The methods (like set_bit and or) depend on accurate invariant properties and specifications that must align with the underlying view and the properties provided by the vstd prelude and Seq library.
- The verification steps for proofs (e.g., updating a bit) depend on proofs generated from the macros (get_bit64, set_bit64) and require the addition of explicit proofs where "TODO: add proof" is present.

### 2. Verification Plan
```
**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
The code explicitly contains a "view" function for BitMap along with markers like "TODO: implement view" and "TODO: add proof", indicating that a proper View function must be developed and refined. Since BitMap is a class/struct data structure needing type invariants, the Full Sequence Workflow is the optimal choice. Additionally, the presence of explicit proof markers necessitates the optional final step of proof_generation.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference – Generate an initial View function (for BitMap::view) to establish the mathematical abstraction of the BitMap’s internal representation.
2. view_refinement – Refine the generated View function to accurately capture the ordering and concatenation properties of the bitmap bits.
3. inv_inference – Since BitMap is a struct, perform invariant inference to derive type invariants that maintain the correctness of the internal “bits” vector.
4. spec_inference – Infer requires and ensures clauses for the functions (e.g., from, get_bit, set_bit, or) to complete their specifications.
5. proof_generation – Append proof_generation as the final step to automatically generate proofs for the functions where the "TODO: add proof" markers are present.

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – the BitMap is a struct requiring type invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes – the code contains "TODO: add proof" markers in methods such as set_bit and or.
