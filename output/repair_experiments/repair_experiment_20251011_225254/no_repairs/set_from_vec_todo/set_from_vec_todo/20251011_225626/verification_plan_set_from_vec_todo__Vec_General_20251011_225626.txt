## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- A struct VecSet is defined with an unfinished "view" function returning Set<u64>.
- Functions (new, insert, contains) have placeholders for specifications ("TODO: add requires and ensures").
- An additional "TODO: add proof" exists in the insert method.
- No invariants are provided for loop bounds or struct consistency.

Dependencies:
- The VecSet::view function must accurately represent the mathematical set of the vector.
- The insert and contains methods rely on the VecSet::view function for correctness assertions.
- Proof obligations also depend on the final specification of VecSet::view.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
- The code explicitly contains a "view" method indicating that a mathematical abstraction (View) is required.
- The data structure is a struct (VecSet), so inv_inference also applies.
- There are specification placeholders ("TODO: add requires and ensures") and a "TODO: add proof."

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – input is a struct (VecSet) needing invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes – there is a "TODO: add proof" in the insert method.
