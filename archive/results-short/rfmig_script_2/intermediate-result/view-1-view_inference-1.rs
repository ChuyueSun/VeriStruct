In most cases this can be provided\nby adding a type annotation. Sometimes you need to specify a generic type\nparameter manually.\n\nIn the example above, type `Vec` has a type parameter `T`. When calling\n`Vec::new`, barring any other later usage of the variable `x` that allows the\ncompiler to infer what type `T` is, the compiler needs to be told what it is.\n\nThe type can be specified on the variable:\n\n```\nlet x: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();\n```\n\nThe type can also be specified in the path of the expression:\n\n```\nlet x = Vec::<i32>::new();\n```\n\nIn cases with more complex types, it is not necessary to annotate the full\ntype. Once the ambiguity is resolved, the compiler can infer the rest:\n\n```\nlet x: Vec<_> = \"hello\".chars().rev().collect();\n```\n\nAnother way to provide the compiler with enough information, is to specify the\ngeneric type parameter:\n\n```\nlet x = \"hello\".chars().rev().collect::<Vec<char>>();\n```\n\nAgain, you need not specify the full type if the compiler can infer it:\n\n```\nlet x = \"hello\".chars().rev().collect::<Vec<_>>();\n```\n\nApart from a method or function with a generic type parameter, this error can\noccur when a type parameter of a struct or trait cannot be inferred. In that\ncase it is not always possible to use a type annotation, because all candidates\nhave the same return type. For instance:\n\n```compile_fail,E0282\nstruct Foo<T> {\n    num: T,\n}\n\nimpl<T> Foo<T> {\n    fn bar() -> i32 {\n        0\n    }\n\n    fn baz() {\n        let number = Foo::bar();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis will fail because the compiler does not know which instance of `Foo` to\ncall `bar` on. Change `Foo::bar()` to `Foo::<T>::bar()` to resolve the error.\n"},"level":"error","spans":[{"file_name":"/var/folders/nh/_8qdng_n3357qvdjjrx5mchw0000gn/T/tmpv4ibglug","byte_start":944,"byte_end":947,"line_start":31,"line_end":31,"column_start":21,"column_end":24,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"        *counter == old(*counter) + 1,","highlight_start":21,"highlight_end":24}],"label":"cannot infer type of the type parameter `A` declared on the function `old`","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null}],"children":[{"message":"consider specifying the generic argument","code":null,"level":"help","spans":[{"file_name":"/var/folders/nh/_8qdng_n3357qvdjjrx5mchw0000gn/T/tmpv4ibglug","byte_start":947,"byte_end":947,"line_start":31,"line_end":31,"column_start":24,"column_end":24,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"        *counter == old(*counter) + 1,","highlight_start":24,"highlight_end":24}],"label":null,"suggested_replacement":"::<A>","suggestion_applicability":"HasPlaceholders","expansion":null}],"children":[],"rendered":null}],"rendered":"error[E0282]: type annotations needed\n  --> /var/folders/nh/_8qdng_n3357qvdjjrx5mchw0000gn/T/tmpv4ibglug:31:21\n   |\n31 |         *counter == old(*counter) + 1,\n   |                     ^^^ cannot infer type of the type parameter `A` declared on the function `old`\n   |\nhelp: consider specifying the generic argument\n   |\n31 |         *counter == old::<A>(*counter) + 1,\n   |                        +++++\n\n"}
