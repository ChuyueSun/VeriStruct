## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a Lock<T> struct (via struct_with_invariants!) and a take function, both of which have placeholder TODOs for adding invariants and specifications.
- There is no mention of a "View" requirement (e.g., no "implement View" or "TODO: add View").
- The Lock<T> type requires a well_formed invariant specification, and the take function requires both requires/ensures clauses and loop invariants.

Dependencies:
- The Lock struct’s well_formed predicate depends on an invariant describing how the bool state relates to Option<T>.
- The take function’s loop invariants will likely reference Lock’s well_formed property.
- The specification for take requires preconditions (assumptions about Lock) and postconditions (the returned Tracked<T>).

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
Because the code contains a struct needing type invariants ("TODO: add invariants" in struct/loop) and also needs requires/ensures for a function ("TODO: add requires and ensures"), but there is no mention of any View function, the Invariant-First Workflow applies.

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference
3. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes (the Lock<T> is a struct with invariants to define)
- proof_generation: Yes (there is a “TODO: add invariants,” which triggers a final proof_generation step)
```
