Current State:
- A “view” function is declared but not implemented (TODO: implement view).
- The BitMap struct needs specifications: from, get_bit, set_bit, and or all have TODOs for requires/ensures.
- There are TODOs for “add proof” in set_bit, indicating proof obligations remain incomplete.
- The code is a data structure (struct BitMap) with a required view function.

Dependencies:
- The BitMap::view() function forms the mathematical abstraction for the BitMap struct.
- Functions (from, get_bit, set_bit, or) rely on proper specifications and must align with the BitMap view.
- The proof needed for set_bit depends on a refined view and correct specification of invariants and requires/ensures.

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
We must generate and refine a View function for the BitMap (the code explicitly contains “View” usage and a TODO to implement it). Additionally, there are TODOs for requires/ensures, and the input is a struct data structure needing invariants. Therefore, the full sequence (view_inference → view_refinement → inv_inference → spec_inference) applies. Because there's a “TODO: add proof”, we append proof_generation as a final step.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes (BitMap is a struct data structure with implied invariants).
- proof_generation: Yes (there is a "TODO: add proof" in the code).
