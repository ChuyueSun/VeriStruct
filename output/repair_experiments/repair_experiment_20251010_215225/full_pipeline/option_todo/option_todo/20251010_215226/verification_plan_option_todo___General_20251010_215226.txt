```markdown
Current State:
- The code defines an enum (MyOption) and includes multiple “TODO: add specification” markers for open spec functions and “TODO: add requires and ensures” markers for methods.
- There is no mention of needing a type invariant nor any reference to “View” or “TODO: add View”.

Dependencies:
- The MyOption functions depend on correct requires/ensures specifications.
- No additional invariants or View functions are indicated by the TODOs.

```

```markdown
**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
The code requests specifications for functions (“TODO: add specification” and “TODO: add requires/ensures”) but does not require any type invariants. There is no mention of a “View” implementation or data-structure invariants, so the Specification-Only Workflow is sufficient.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No – the code does not request type invariants for MyOption.
- proof_generation: No – there is no “TODO: add proof” or “TODO: add invariants” marker.
```
