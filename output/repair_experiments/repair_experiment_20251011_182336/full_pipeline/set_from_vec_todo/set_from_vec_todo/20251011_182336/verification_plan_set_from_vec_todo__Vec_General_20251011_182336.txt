## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a struct "VecSet" and explicitly includes a "view" function returning a mathematical abstraction (Set<u64>).
- Multiple TODOs exist for adding requires/ensures (specifications), adding proofs, and adding an invariant.
- There is an explicit "View" method (view()) that indicates advanced verification is needed to reflect the data structure’s state as a mathematical set.

Dependencies:
- The "view" function must accurately represent the array contents as a set.
- The functions "new", "insert", and "contains" need proper function specifications (requires and ensures).
- Proper invariants must be included (e.g., loop invariants in "contains", data-structure invariants if necessary).
- A proof is required to justify any correctness arguments, as suggested by "TODO: add proof".

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
Since the code explicitly contains a "view" function that must reflect the data structure's contents, the verification strategy must include view-related inference and refinement. Additionally, a struct is present and requires invariants. The code has TODOs for specifications and proofs, so the complete workflow is needed.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation  (added because "TODO: add proof" and "TODO: add invariant" are present)

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes (the input is a struct data structure needing type invariants)
- proof_generation: Yes (there is a “TODO: add proof” marker)
```
