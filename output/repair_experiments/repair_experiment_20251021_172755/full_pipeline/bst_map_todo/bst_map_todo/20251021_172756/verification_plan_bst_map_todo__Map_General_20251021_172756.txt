## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a TreeMap data structure implementing a binary search tree (BST). It includes a Node struct and a root pointer in TreeMap.
- A “View” trait is explicitly implemented, with a placeholder "TODO: add specification" in the view() function.
- Several methods (new, insert, delete, get, etc.) have specification TODOs or references to proof insertions.
- The code provides a type_invariant attribute for TreeMap, indicating the need for invariants.
- There is a "TODO: add proof" marker (for example, in TreeMap::insert).

Identified Missing Components:
- View function bodies are incomplete ("TODO: add specification" in as_map and view).
- Function specifications (requires/ensures) are missing across multiple methods.
- Proof steps are needed to ensure BST properties and handle insertion/deletion correctness.

Critical Verification Challenges:
- Verifying that each method preserves BST properties and updates the as_map representation correctly.
- Filling in the “View” requirement with a sound mapping from the data structure to a Map<u64, V>.
- Ensuring type invariants (well_formed) hold after insertions/deletions.
- Adding proof code to validate the correctness of operations.

Dependencies:
- Node and TreeMap rely on consistent BST properties (well_formed).
- The “View” trait uses the TreeMap’s as_map logic to provide a verified view.
- Each method’s verification depends on the well-formedness invariants and the as_map representation.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
1. The code explicitly implements the “View” trait and references “View” in multiple places (e.g., "impl<V> View for TreeMap<V>" with a TODO for the view() function).
2. The data structure is a struct (TreeMap and Node) with an explicit type invariant. Hence, we include inv_inference in the plan.
3. There are numerous specification placeholders (“TODO: add specification”) and a “TODO: add proof” marker indicates we need a final proof_generation step.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference   (because Node and TreeMap are struct data types)
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation (due to “TODO: add proof” in the code)

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes - the input is a struct data structure (Node<V> and TreeMap<V>) requiring invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes - “TODO: add proof” is present in the insert method, necessitating final proof generation after specs are inferred.
