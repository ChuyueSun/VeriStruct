Current State:
- The code defines a struct Lock<T> with invariants (using struct_with_invariants!).
- There are explicit TODO markers to add requires, ensures, and loop invariants.
- There is no mention of a View or View-related TODO.
- Therefore, the code needs both type invariants and function specifications, but no dedicated View.

Dependencies:
- The Lock<T> data structure and its well_formed function need type invariants.
- The take function and well_formed function both require specifications.
- The loop in the take function requires an invariant.

```

**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
We have a struct data structure (Lock<T>) that requires type invariants, and there are TODO markers for adding requires/ensures. There is no explicit View implementation or View-related requirement. Hence the Invariant-First Workflow is appropriate.

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference
3. proof_generation  (added because of the "TODO: add invariant" placeholder)

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes - Lock<T> is a struct requiring invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes - The code contains "TODO: add invariant" and "TODO: add specification" markers.
```
