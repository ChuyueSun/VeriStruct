## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a BST node struct (Node<V>) with various operations (insert, delete, get), and an open spec function (well_formed) that currently lacks its invariant body ("TODO: add invariant").
- Multiple functions also have "TODO: add requires and ensures" placeholders, indicating missing function specifications.
- There is no explicit "View" keyword or statement like "TODO: add View" even though the code includes spec functions (as_map, optional_as_map) for an abstract representation.

Dependencies:
- The well_formed function depends on the node structure and its children (left, right) to maintain the BST property.
- The insert/delete operations rely on a correct BST invariant to ensure postconditions (well_formed, map consistency).
- The get operation similarly depends on BST ordering to guarantee correctness of the search.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
This code involves a struct data structure needing type invariants (the BST property) and also contains "TODO: add requires/ensures" placeholders. There is no explicit requirement for a "View" trait or mention of "TODO: add View," so the Full Sequence Workflow is not applicable. Hence, the Invariant-First Workflow (inv_inference → spec_inference) is most appropriate.

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference
3. proof_generation  ← (appended because "TODO: add invariant" is present)

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes (the Node struct needs a well_formed invariant).
- proof_generation: Yes (due to "TODO: add invariant" and "TODO: add requires and ensures" markers).
