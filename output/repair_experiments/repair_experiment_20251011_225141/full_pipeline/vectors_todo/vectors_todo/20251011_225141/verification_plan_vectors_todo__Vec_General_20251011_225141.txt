## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code contains three functions (binary_search, reverse, binary_search_no_spinoff) missing requires/ensures ("TODO: add specification").
- It also contains "TODO: add invariants" for the loops in these functions, but these invariants are loop invariants, not type invariants for a data structure.
- No data structures (classes/structs) are defined, and no View functions are referenced or requested explicitly.

Dependencies:
- The main dependency is between each function and its specification.
- The loop invariants are local to each function and do not require type invariants.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
- There is no custom data structure needing type invariants, so no need for inv_inference.
- There is no mention of any required View implementation, so a Full Sequence Workflow is unnecessary.
- The "TODO: add specification" markers clearly indicate the need for function specifications only.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference
2. proof_generation  (added because "TODO: add invariants" text is present)

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No – there is no class/struct data structure requiring type invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes – "TODO: add invariants" is present, so proof_generation is appended.
```
