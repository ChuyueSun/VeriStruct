## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code contains three functions (binary_search, reverse, binary_search_no_spinoff) and test functions.
- Each function has a "TODO: add specification" placeholder.
- Loops have "TODO: add invariants" placeholders, but there is no custom struct or class data structure to attach type invariants to.
- There is no mention of "View" or "view" in the code.

Identified Missing Components:
- Requires/ensures clauses for each function (as indicated by "TODO: add specification").
- Loop invariants (as indicated by "TODO: add invariants").

Critical Verification Challenges:
- Ensuring the loop invariants capture the key properties for correctness of binary search and reverse operations.
- Providing the appropriate preconditions and postconditions for the given functions.

Dependencies:
- The loop invariants for binary search and reverse rely on the sorted property of the vector, array bounds, and correct item swapping.
- No custom data structure dependencies exist (only standard library Vec is used).

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
The code does not define any custom struct or class, so there is no need for type invariants (inv_inference). It also does not mention or require any "View" functions, so a full sequence workflow is not triggered. The primary requests are "TODO: add specification" and loop invariants, which aligns with using the Specification-Only Workflow.

Because the code contains "TODO: add invariants," we append a proof_generation step at the end to fulfill proof obligations associated with those invariants.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference
2. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No (there is no class/struct data structure).
- proof_generation: Yes (due to "TODO: add invariants" in the code).
