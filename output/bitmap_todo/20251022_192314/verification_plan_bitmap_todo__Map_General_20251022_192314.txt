Current State:
- The code defines a struct BitMap with a “view” function that is not yet implemented (marked "TODO: implement view").
- It also includes “TODO: add requires and ensures” and “TODO: add proof” markers for various methods (from, set_bit, or).
- Hence, both a custom View function and function specifications/proofs are missing.

Dependencies:
- The BitMap struct depends on a well-defined view() to abstract its bits vector to a Seq<bool>.
- The from, set_bit, and or methods need requires/ensures clauses (spec_inference) and require additional proof obligations in proof_generation.

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
We see an explicit View function (“spec fn view”) and a TODO comment to implement it. This triggers the Full Sequence Workflow. Since BitMap is a struct, we include inv_inference in the pipeline. We also have multiple “TODO: add proof” comments, so proof_generation is added as the final step.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – BitMap is a struct-type data structure, so we generate and refine any needed invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes – We have “TODO: add proof” markers in set_bit and or methods.
