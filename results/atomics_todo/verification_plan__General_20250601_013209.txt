### Step 1: Analyze the task

The code defines a data structure Lock<T> which embeds an AtomicBool field, along with a “well_formed” function that is clearly intended to establish or describe invariants about the internal state. This indicates the need for a mathematical View function representing the abstract data the Lock holds and how it behaves when locked/unlocked. Additionally, the function “take” likely needs invariants and specifications to describe locking procedures. Since the code has a data structure with invariants that must be formalized as part of its verification, it fits a scenario where we need both a View function and invariants. Therefore, the Full Sequence Workflow is most appropriate.

### Step 2: Choose the Workflow

**Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow  
**Explanation:** Because the Lock<T> data structure requires a formal View representing its state, and “take” function must rely on invariants and requires/ensures clauses, it is best to do view_inference, view_refinement, inv_inference, and then spec_inference in that order.
