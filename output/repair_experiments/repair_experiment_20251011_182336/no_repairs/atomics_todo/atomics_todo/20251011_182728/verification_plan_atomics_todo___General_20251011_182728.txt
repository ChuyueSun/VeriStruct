Current State:
- The code defines a Lock<T> struct with a missing invariant in well_formed (marked "TODO: add specification").
- The take<T> function also lacks requires/ensures clauses and loop invariants (marked "TODO: add requires and ensures" and "TODO: add invariants").
- No explicit “View” requirements are present, but the Lock<T> struct suggests we need type invariants.
- A separate AtomicInvariantPredicate is declared (VEqualG), also missing specifications.

Dependencies:
- The Lock<T> struct depends on a correctness invariant relating the bool and Option<T>.
- The take function needs loop invariants and function specs tied to the Lock<T> invariants.
- The VEqualG predicate depends on correct atomic invariants for the associated type.

**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
The code defines a struct Lock<T> (a class/struct data structure) that clearly needs invariants, plus there are "TODO" markers for requires/ensures specifications in the functions. There is no mention of a "View" function requirement, so the Full Sequence Workflow (which includes view steps) is not needed. Thus, we apply the Invariant-First Workflow to generate invariants and then function specifications.

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference
3. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes - Lock<T> is a data structure requiring invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes - "TODO: add invariants" is present, so we add a final proof_generation step.
