Current State:
- The code defines a struct (FixedParity) that implements RwLockPredicate but leaves the inv function incomplete with "TODO: add specification".
- This indicates both a data structure (requiring invariants) and a specification placeholder ("TODO: add specification").
- No references to "View" or "TODO: add View" were found.

Dependencies:
- The FixedParity struct’s inv function underlies the RwLock’s correctness.
- Properly specifying inv is required so that the RwLock’s invariants can hold.

```

**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
Because there is a struct (FixedParity) needing a typed invariant and there is a “TODO: add specification” placeholder, we must first infer invariants for the struct, then infer the specification. There is no mention of “View”, so we do not use the Full Sequence Workflow.

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – FixedParity is a struct requiring an invariant for RwLockPredicate.
- proof_generation: No – the code does not contain “TODO: add proof” or “TODO: add invariants”.
```
