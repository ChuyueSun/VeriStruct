Current State:
- We have a struct VecSet with a “view” function that explicitly references a Set<u64> abstraction.
- Several TODO markers exist for adding requires/ensures (function specs), invariants, and proofs.
- There is an explicit “view” function and a data structure, indicating the need for a complete verification solution.

Dependencies:
- The VecSet’s mathematical abstraction is tied to the view() function returning a Set<u64>.
- The insert and contains methods depend on each other through the shared vector “vt” and ultimately need specifications referring to the view.
- The presence of “TODO: add proof” indicates additional proof obligations will be necessary once the specs and invariants are in place.

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
This code explicitly contains a “view” function for VecSet, triggering the requirement for View inference and refinement. Additionally, it is a struct with placeholders for function specifications and invariants, so it qualifies for a full verification solution including both spec- and invariant-related inference. Because it is a data structure, we also include inv_inference in the workflow.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – VecSet is a struct and requires invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes – “TODO: add proof” markers are present in the code.
