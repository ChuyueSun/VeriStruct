## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a struct "FixedParity" implementing the RwLockPredicate trait but leaves the body of the "inv" function empty with "TODO: add specification".
- There is a data-structure-like type ("FixedParity") that needs a correctness predicate for verification (i.e., how "parity" relates to the stored value).
- No explicit "View" implementation or references to adding/view refining are present.

Dependencies:
- "FixedParity" depends on the RwLockPredicate trait from vstd::rwlock.
- Invariants for "FixedParity" may need to ensure correct use in RwLock invariants.
- The function “FixedParity::inv” must align with the RwLock’s verification requirements.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
There is a struct data structure ("FixedParity"), and we have a "TODO: add specification" placeholder indicating we need to fill in or refine the specification. We do not need to generate or refine any View function, so the Invariant-First Workflow (“inv_inference → spec_inference”) is appropriate.

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – "FixedParity" is a struct-like type needing an invariant definition for its "inv" method.
- proof_generation: No – There is no "TODO: add proof" or "TODO: add invariants" text in the code.
