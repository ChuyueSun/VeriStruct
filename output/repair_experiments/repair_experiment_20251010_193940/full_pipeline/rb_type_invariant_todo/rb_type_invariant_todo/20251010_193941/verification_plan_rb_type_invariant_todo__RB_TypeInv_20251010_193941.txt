## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a RingBuffer struct that implements the "View" trait but has no actual View function provided (marked “TODO: add specification”).
- Several methods in RingBuffer have “TODO: add requires and ensures” and “TODO: add proof” placeholders, indicating missing specification and proof content.
- The ring buffer also has a “type_invariant” but no invariant body is defined (marked “TODO: add specification”).
- No verification errors are explicitly listed, but the code is incomplete and cannot be fully verified due to missing components.

Dependencies:
- The RingBuffer struct is central: it requires a View function for its abstract model, type invariants, and function specifications.
- Each public method (len, has_elements, is_full, new, enqueue, dequeue, available_len) has specification and proof placeholders that depend on both the struct’s invariant and its View function.
- The proofs within these methods will need the completed invariant and View definitions in order to verify correctness.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
- The code explicitly contains "impl<T: Copy> View for RingBuffer<T>", so a View implementation is required.
- The code includes a struct (RingBuffer) with a “type_invariant” annotation and “TODO: add specification” for its fields and methods.
- Function specifications (“requires” and “ensures”) are also requested for multiple methods, and there are “TODO: add proof” comments indicating the need for proof blocks.
- Because of the explicit “View” trait and a struct requiring type invariants, the Full Sequence Workflow applies: view_inference → view_refinement → inv_inference → spec_inference, plus a final proof_generation step to address the “TODO: add proof”.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes (we have a RingBuffer struct with a type_invariant annotation)
- proof_generation: Yes (“TODO: add proof” markers appear throughout the code)
```
