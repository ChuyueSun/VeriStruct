## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- Multiple functions in MyOption (an enum) have "TODO: add specification" and "TODO: add requires and ensures."
- No invariants are mentioned or requested.
- No "View" or "TODO: add view" is present.

Dependencies:
- The MyOption code depends on open spec functions (is_Some, is_None, etc.) needing requires/ensures.
- No explicit dependency on invariants or View abstractions.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
Since we only see "TODO: add specification" and "TODO: add requires/ensures," and there is no mention of any type invariants nor any request for a View, the Specification-Only Workflow is most appropriate. The code is an enum rather than a struct/class, so no invariants are required here.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No – the code is an enum, and no invariants or struct-based data types were requested.
- proof_generation: No – there are no "TODO: add proof" or "TODO: add invariants" markers in the code.
