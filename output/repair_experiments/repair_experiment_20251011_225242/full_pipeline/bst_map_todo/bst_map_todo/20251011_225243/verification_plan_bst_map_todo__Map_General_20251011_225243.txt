## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code includes a TreeMap<V> struct (and a Node<V> struct) that implements a BST-like data structure.
- There is an explicit “impl<V> View for TreeMap<V>” block indicating a need for a View function.
- Several “TODO: add specification” markers are present (e.g., for the as_map function, view, and requires/ensures in multiple methods).
- A “TODO: add proof” marker is also present (e.g., in insert).

Identified Missing Components:
- Specifications (requires/ensures) for new, insert, delete, get, etc.
- The implementation of the TreeMap::as_map and TreeMap::view methods.
- Proof blocks to uphold the BST invariants and other correctness conditions.

Critical Verification Challenges:
- Ensuring the BST invariant (well_formed) is correctly proven through each insertion, deletion, and lookup.
- Completing the mapping representation (as_map) and verifying its correctness with the BST structure.
- Fulfilling the specification requirements for the newly added or planned methods.

Dependencies:
- TreeMap depends on Node to represent subtrees, and Node in turn relies on the optional_as_map function for its mathematical abstraction.
- The correctness of TreeMap::as_map depends on Node’s as_map and optional_as_map.
- The correctness of insert/delete/get methods depends on well_formed invariants and their respective proof obligations.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
The code explicitly implements “View” for TreeMap, which necessitates generating and refining a View function. Additionally, TreeMap is a struct that requires type invariants. Since “View” is mentioned, we use the Full Sequence Workflow (view_inference → view_refinement → inv_inference → spec_inference). Furthermore, there is a “TODO: add proof” marker, so we append proof_generation at the end.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes (TreeMap<V> is a struct requiring invariants).
- proof_generation: Yes (“TODO: add proof” is explicitly present).
