### 1. Analysis Summary
```markdown
Current State:
- The code consists solely of functions (no classes/structs) with missing function specifications and loop invariants.
- Several placeholders indicate missing requires/ensures and loop invariants using "TODO: add specification" and "TODO: add invariants".
- The functions binary_search, reverse, and binary_search_no_spinoff need proper specification and invariant proofs.

Dependencies:
- The correctness of binary_search and binary_search_no_spinoff relies on loop invariants to establish progress and termination.
- The reverse function’s postcondition is dependent on a valid snapshot of the initial vector.
- The test functions rely on the correctness and proper specification of the algorithmic functions.
```

### 2. Verification Plan
```markdown
**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
The input code does not contain any class/struct data structures and therefore does not require view or invariant inference modules. Instead, the code only requires function specifications to be added for proper verification, as indicated by the "TODO: add specification" markers. Since there are placeholders for loop invariants ("TODO: add invariants"), a final proof generation step is also needed.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference
2. proof_generation  (appended due to "TODO: add invariants" markers)

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No – input does not contain class/struct data structures.
- proof_generation: Yes – because "TODO: add invariants" (and specification TODOs) are present.
```
