## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines two data structures (Node and TreeMap) and implements the “View” trait, indicating a need for a View-based solution.
- Several “TODO: add specification” and “TODO: add requires and ensures” markers exist, showing that function specifications are incomplete.
- There are also “TODO: add proof” markers, indicating a need for final proof obligations.

Dependencies:
- Both Node and TreeMap rely on a well_formed invariant, and TreeMap's type_invariant references the Node's BST property.
- The View for TreeMap needs to correspond to its as_map, ensuring consistent specification logic for the entire tree.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
- The code explicitly contains "View" trait usage (“impl View for TreeMap<V>”), requiring a view-based solution.
- It also defines struct data types (Node and TreeMap), justifying the inv_inference step.
- Multiple “TODO” markers indicate missing specifications and proofs, requiring the complete verification sequence.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – There are struct data structures (Node and TreeMap) that require invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes – “TODO: add proof” markers are present in the code.
