## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines two data structures (Node and TreeMap) with an explicit "impl View for TreeMap<V>" block, indicating a View function is required.
- There are multiple “TODO” placeholders: "TODO: add specification" in the as_map and view methods, and "TODO: add requires and ensures" for the functions new, insert, delete, get, etc.
- There is also a “TODO: add proof” placeholder in the TreeMap insert method.
- A type invariant (well_formed) is already present for TreeMap, which guards BST correctness.

Identified missing components:
- A complete specification for the View trait’s view() method.
- Proper requires/ensures clauses for many public functions.
- A proof block is required in some methods (e.g., TreeMap’s insert method).
- The as_map method in TreeMap is missing its specification body.

Critical verification challenges:
- Ensuring BST invariants are maintained across all insert/delete operations.
- Proving the relationship between the code and its mathematical view as a Map<u64, V>.
- Completing specification for the View trait and relevant functions.

Dependencies:
- The TreeMap type_invariant depends on each Node being well-formed.
- The Node struct’s well_formed property relies on its recursive subtree structure.
- The as_map computations depend on correctly unioning the subtrees and maintaining BST semantics.
- The trait View depends on the as_map logic to represent the structure as a Map.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
- The code explicitly includes “impl View for TreeMap<V>”, which invokes a need for a view function.
- There are “TODO: add specification” and “TODO: add proof” markers, indicating we need end-to-end verification.
- A data structure (TreeMap and Node) is present, so the optional inv_inference step applies.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation  (added because of “TODO: add proof” placeholders)

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – the input is a class/struct data structure (Node/TreeMap) needing type invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes – “TODO: add proof” is in the code.
