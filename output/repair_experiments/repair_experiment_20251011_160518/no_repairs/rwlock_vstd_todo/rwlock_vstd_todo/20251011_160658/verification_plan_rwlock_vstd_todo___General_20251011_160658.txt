Current State:
- The struct FixedParity implements RwLockPredicate<u64> but its inv(self, v: u64) function is missing a specification.
- A "TODO: add specification" placeholder appears, indicating that we need to introduce or refine function pre/post conditions.
- There is no mention of any custom View requirements or "TODO: add View."
- FixedParity is a struct, so we may need invariants or specifications related to its usage in the RwLock context.

Dependencies:
- The correctness of FixedParity’s inv() function is required by the RwLock to validate stored values.
- The test function test() uses locks with FixedParity, checking even/odd properties for the underlying data.

**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
The code includes a struct (FixedParity) that may require type invariants and also has a "TODO: add specification" placeholder, indicating we need function specs. There is no mention of View functions or a "TODO: add View," so the Invariant-First Workflow (inv_inference → spec_inference) is most appropriate here.

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – FixedParity is a struct that can benefit from inferred invariants for parity.
- proof_generation: No – Only a "TODO: add specification" is found (no "TODO: add proof" or "TODO: add invariants").
