Current State:
- The struct "FixedParity" implements the RwLockPredicate trait but leaves its predicate function body empty ("TODO: add specification").
- This indicates a missing function specification (requires/ensures), specifically the predicate condition "v % 2 == self.parity".
- There is no mention of additional invariants for "FixedParity", nor any hint of needing a View function.

Dependencies:
- The RwLock data structure depends on the RwLockPredicate::inv being specified correctly.
- No additional dependencies on internal invariants or View implementations.

```

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
Since "FixedParity" does not appear to require a separate type invariant and there is a sole placeholder "TODO: add specification", it qualifies for specifying function requirements/ensures only. There is no explicit mention of needing a View function or data structure invariants.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No – the struct does not require its own type invariants.
- proof_generation: No – there is no “TODO: add proof” or “TODO: add invariants.”
```
