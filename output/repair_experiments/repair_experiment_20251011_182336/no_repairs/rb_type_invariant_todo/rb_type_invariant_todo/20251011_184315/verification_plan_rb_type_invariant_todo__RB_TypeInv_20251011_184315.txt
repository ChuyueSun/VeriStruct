## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a struct (RingBuffer<T>) with a type_invariant and implements “impl<T: Copy> View for RingBuffer<T>,” indicating a need for both invariants and an explicit View function.
- Multiple functions (e.g., len, enqueue, dequeue) have “TODO: add requires and ensures” and “TODO: add proof” markers, signaling that specification clauses and proofs are missing.

Identified Missing Components:
- View function body (“TODO: add specification” in impl<T: Copy> View for RingBuffer<T>).
- Type invariant details within RingBuffer<T>::inv.
- Function specifications (requires/ensures) for ring buffer methods.
- Proof bodies for each method marked with “TODO: add proof.”

Critical Verification Challenges:
- Ensuring the ring buffer’s invariants and View function align with its conceptual model.
- Verifying array-index safety and ring wraparound arithmetic in methods like enqueue, dequeue, and available_len.

Dependencies:
- The ring buffer’s type invariant (inv) underpins the correctness of each method.
- The ring buffer’s “View” implementation must properly represent the mathematical abstraction of the ring's state.
- Each ring buffer method’s specification (requires/ensures) depends on the type_invariant and the View function to align correctness with the data structure’s model.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
Because the code explicitly implements “View” for the RingBuffer struct, we must generate and refine a View function. Furthermore, RingBuffer is a struct requiring invariants, and the methods have “TODO: add requires/ensures” markers. Therefore, the full sequence workflow is mandated:
(view_inference → view_refinement → inv_inference → spec_inference),
and we include inv_inference because RingBuffer is a struct. We finally append proof_generation due to the multiple “TODO: add proof” markers.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – the input is a struct (RingBuffer) requiring a type_invariant.
- proof_generation: Yes – “TODO: add proof” markers exist throughout the code.
```
