## System
You are a helpful AI assistant specialized in Verus formal verification.

## Instruction

You are a highly experienced expert in Verus (the verifier for Rust). Your task is to refine the "View" function within the given Verus file. The "View" function is the mathematical abstraction for a data structure, capturing the minimal information needed for its specification in Verus.

It is perfectly acceptable to leave the code unchanged if the current abstraction is already appropriate; modify the "View" function only when necessary.

Your responsibilities:
  1. Analyze the current "View" function to determine if its tuple (or other structure) adequately represents the module.
  2. Evaluate whether the abstraction can be improved. (Hint: If the tuple is identical to the internal fields, that is likely not an ideal abstraction.)
  3. Modify only the "View" function to improve its abstraction while leaving all other parts of the file unchanged.
  4. Any refined view must convey at least the same amount of information while being more succinct. Aim to use a flattened tuple that is shorter than the original.
  5. **IMPORTANT**: Do not remove any "// TODO" markers in the code. Preserve all TODO comments exactly as they appear.
  6. Return the **entire updated Verus file** with your refined "View" function (or the original file if no changes were necessary) and nothing else changed.

Please provide only the complete Rust code of the file with no additional commentary.


# Verus Common Knowledge

## Important Notes
- ALWAYS use parentheses whenever possible for clarity!
- Don't delete existing non-buggy `#[trigger]`!
- Don't change "unwind" to `(unwind) as bool`!
- Return the complete modified Rust code in your response without explanations.
- Keep top level docstrings at the top of the file, before `verus! {`. Do not place them after the `verus! {` declaration.
- Don't change any function signatures.

## Spec Functions
1. No Direct Method Calls:
   In a spec function, you cannot directly call instance methods such as vector.is_full().
2. Use the @ Operator:
   To invoke methods on a variable within a spec, first convert it to its specification-level representation View with @.
3. Always use vector.len() instead of vector@.len().
4. Simplify Boolean Conjunctions:
   When combining multiple conditions, avoid excessive &&&. Fewer (or well-structured) conjunctions make the spec code easier to read and debug.
5. Parentheses Usage:
   ALWAYS wrap conditions in parentheses, even for simple expressions. This makes precedence explicit and prevents errors.

## Operators
Verus extends Rust logical operators with low-precedence forms that are especially helpful in specification code:

Standard Operators: &&, ||, ==>, <==>
Low-Precedence Variants: &&& and |||

The meaning of &&& is the same as && (logical AND), and ||| is the same as || (logical OR), but with lower precedence. This allows you to write conditions in a "bulleted list" style that remains grouped in a logical manner:

```
&&& a ==> b
&&& c
&&& d <==> e && f
```

is equivalent to:

```
(a ==> b) && c && (d <==> (e && f))
```

Note:
- Implication (==>) and equivalence (<==>) bind more tightly than &&& and |||.
- Using &&&/||| can make long specifications clearer by grouping logical clauses neatly.


# Verus View Function Guidelines

## View Refinement Guidelines
1. A good View abstraction should:
   - Represent the essential state of the data structure, not just copy its fields
   - Hide implementation details while preserving behavior
   - Be as simple as possible while being complete

2. Common refinements:
   - For collections (arrays, lists): Use Seq<T> instead of raw arrays
   - For indices: Use meaningful representations (e.g., range of valid elements)
   - For flag fields: Consider if they can be derived from other state

3. Avoid redundancy:
   - Only include fields necessary for specification
   - Derive computable properties in method ensures clauses, not in the view

4. Prefer mathematical types over concrete types when possible


# Verus Match Syntax Guidelines

## Using `matches!` Macro

In Verus, the `matches!` macro must use Rust's standard macro syntax:

```rust
// CORRECT
pub open spec fn is_Some<A>(opt: MyOption<A>) -> bool {
    matches!(opt, MyOption::Some(_))
}

// INCORRECT - don't use this syntax
pub open spec fn is_Some<A>(opt: MyOption<A>) -> bool {
    matches opt {
        MyOption::Some(_) => true,
        MyOption::None => false,
    }
}
```

## Match with `arbitrary()` in Spec Functions

When writing spec functions that match on patterns with impossible/unreachable branches, use `arbitrary()` instead of `unreachable!()`:

```rust
// CORRECT
pub open spec fn get_Some_0<A>(opt: MyOption<A>) -> A
    recommends is_Some(opt)
{
    match opt {
        MyOption::Some(a) => a,
        MyOption::None => arbitrary(), // For unreachable branches in spec functions
    }
}

// INCORRECT
pub open spec fn get_Some_0<A>(opt: MyOption<A>) -> A
    recommends is_Some(opt)
{
    match opt {
        MyOption::Some(a) => a,
        MyOption::None => unreachable!(), // Don't use this in spec functions
    }
}
```

## Match in Executable Functions

For unreachable branches in executable functions, use `unreached()`:

```rust
pub fn unwrap(self) -> (a: A)
    requires
        is_Some(self),
    ensures
        a == get_Some_0(self),
{
    match self {
        MyOption::Some(a) => a,
        MyOption::None => unreached(), // For unreachable branches in exec functions
    }
}
```

## Match in Proof Functions

For unreachable branches in proof functions, use `proof_from_false()`:

```rust
pub proof fn tracked_unwrap(tracked self) -> (tracked a: A)
    requires
        is_Some(self),
    ensures
        a == get_Some_0(self),
{
    match self {
        MyOption::Some(a) => a,
        MyOption::None => proof_from_false(), // For unreachable branches in proof functions
    }
}
```


# Verus Sequence Knowledge

Seq<T> is a mathematical sequence type used in specifications:

- Building: Seq::empty(), seq![x, y, z], Seq::singleton(x)
- Length: s.len()
- Indexing: s[i] (0-based)
- Subrange: s.subrange(lo, hi) gives elements from index lo (inclusive) to hi (exclusive)
- Concatenation: s1 + s2
- Update: s.update(i, v) returns a new sequence with index i updated to value v
- Contains: s.contains(v) checks if v is in the sequence
- Push/pop: s.push(v), s.pop() (returns new sequence, doesn't modify original)
- Equality: Use `=~=` for sequence equality, NOT `==` (e.g., `seq1 =~= seq2`, `self@.0 =~= old(self)@.0.subrange(1, (old(self)@.0.len()) as int)`)

You can use forall or exists for properties over sequences.

## Subrange Usage

1. Cast indices to `int`: `self.head as int`, not just `self.head`
2. Use `.subrange(start, end)`, not `seq[start..end]`
3. Wrap complex expressions: `(..).subrange((expression) as int, ...)`
4. For full length: `(sequence.len()) as int`


# Verus Set Usage Guide

## Overview
`Set<A>` is a specification type representing mathematical sets. Sets can be finite or infinite and are used primarily in specifications (spec functions, requires/ensures clauses).

## Construction

```rust
// Empty set
let s1 = Set::<A>::empty();

// Full set (all elements of type A)
let s2 = Set::<A>::full();

// Set from predicate
let s3 = Set::new(|x: nat| x < 10);

// Set literal using macro
let s4 = set![1, 2, 3, 4];
```

## Core Operations

```rust
// Check membership
s.contains(x)          // returns bool
s has x                // alternative syntax

// Insert/remove elements
s.insert(x)            // returns new set with x added
s.remove(x)            // returns new set with x removed

// Set operations
s1.union(s2)           // or s1 + s2
s1.intersect(s2)       // or s1 * s2
s1.difference(s2)      // or s1 - s2
s.complement()         // returns complement of s
s.filter(f)            // filter by predicate f

// Subset relation
s1.subset_of(s2)       // or s1 <= s2
```

## Finite Sets

```rust
// Check finiteness
s.finite()             // returns bool

// Operations on finite sets
s.len()                // cardinality (requires s.finite())
s.choose()             // picks arbitrary element

// Useful predicates
s.disjoint(s2)         // s and s2 have no common elements
```

## Equality

Use extensional equality `=~=` to compare sets:
```rust
ensures s1 =~= s2      // s1 and s2 contain same elements
```

## Common Axioms

Key broadcast axioms automatically available:
- `axiom_set_insert_same`: `s.insert(a).contains(a)`
- `axiom_set_remove_same`: `!s.remove(a).contains(a)`
- `axiom_set_union`: `s1.union(s2).contains(a) == (s1.contains(a) || s2.contains(a))`
- `axiom_set_ext_equal`: `s1 =~= s2 <==> forall|a| s1.contains(a) == s2.contains(a)`

Use `broadcast use group_set_axioms;` to enable all set axioms in a proof block.

## Example Usage

```rust
proof fn example_set_proof() {
    let s1 = set![1, 2, 3];
    let s2 = set![3, 4, 5];

    assert(s1.insert(4).contains(4));
    assert(s1.union(s2).contains(1));
    assert(s1.intersect(s2) =~= set![3]);
    assert(s1.finite() && s1.len() == 3);
}
```

## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- A struct VecSet is defined, containing a Vec<u64>.
- There is a "pub closed spec fn view()" indicating an explicit need for a View function.
- Several functions (new, insert, contains) contain "TODO: add requires and ensures" markers, indicating missing specifications.
- There is also a "TODO: add proof" in the insert method.
- A for-loop in contains suggests a possible invariant or loop assertion requirement.

Dependencies:
- The VecSet struct’s correctness hinges on properly defining its View function for abstraction.
- Each function (new, insert, contains) depends on correct specifications (requires/ensures).
- Final proofs may depend on the correctness of the View function and any type or loop invariants inferred.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
- The code explicitly includes a "pub closed spec fn view", satisfying the condition for a View implementation.
- There are "TODO: add requires and ensures" placeholders in multiple functions. Therefore, we need a comprehensive approach to cover views, invariants (as indicated in the code’s loop), and specifications.
- The VecSet is a struct, so including inv_inference is appropriate.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation  (added because of "TODO: add proof")

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – the input is a struct requiring invariants (e.g., the loop invariant in contains).
- proof_generation: Yes – there is a "TODO: add proof" in the insert method.
```
