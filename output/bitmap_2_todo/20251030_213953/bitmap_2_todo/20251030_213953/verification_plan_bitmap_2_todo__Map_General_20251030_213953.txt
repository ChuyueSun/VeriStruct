### 1. Analysis Summary
- Current State:
  - The code defines u64 bit‐vector proof functions and then implements a BitMap struct with several methods. The BitMap’s view function, as well as several method pre-/post-conditions (e.g. in from, get_bit, set_bit, or), are left as placeholders (“TODO: …”).
  - Additionally, there are “TODO: add proof” comments indicating that proofs for bit‐vector operations and correctness of sequence updates have not yet been generated.
- Identified Missing Components:
  - A concrete implementation of the view function for BitMap.
  - Requires/ensures specifications for the BitMap methods.
  - Loop invariants in the while-loop of the or method.
  - Proof blocks for verifying proper bit‐vector updating and sequence consistency.
- Critical Verification Challenges:
  - Integrating a complete numerical abstraction (via view functions) with type invariants and method specifications.
  - Providing sufficient proof generation to address all “TODO: add proof” markers throughout the code.
- Dependencies:
  - The BitMap struct depends on the proper implementation and refinement of its view function.
  - The correctness proofs of set_bit and or methods rely on the underlying bit vector proofs (set_bit64_proof and bit_or_64_proof).
  - Specification inference steps must correctly capture the function requirements and invariants for proper verification.

### 2. Verification Plan
```markdown
**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
The code explicitly contains a specification function (the view function) with a "TODO: Implement the view function" marker and multiple placeholders for requires/ensures clauses in the BitMap methods. Since BitMap is a struct (class data structure) and its methods need invariants and full specifications, the Full Sequence Workflow is appropriate. Additionally, the presence of “TODO: add proof” markers indicates that proof generation must be appended as the final step.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference – Automatically generate a View function for BitMap to capture its mathematical abstraction.
2. view_refinement – Refine the generated View function to improve its mathematical representation.
3. inv_inference – Infer type invariants for the BitMap struct (since BitMap is a class/struct data structure).
4. spec_inference – Infer the requires and ensures clauses for the functions (for from, get_bit, set_bit, or, etc.) where they are omitted.
5. proof_generation – Append proof generation as a final step to handle the “TODO: add proof” markers indicated throughout the code.

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – the BitMap struct qualifies as a class/struct data structure needing type invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes – “TODO: add proof” markers are present, prompting the addition of proof generation as the final step.
