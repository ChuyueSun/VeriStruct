Current State:
- The code defines a BitMap struct with an internal Vec<u64> storage.
- There is a "spec fn view" that needs an implementation (explicit "View" mention).
- Multiple methods have "TODO: add requires and ensures" indicating missing specifications.
- There are "TODO: add proof" placeholders in the set_bit and or methods.
- A loop invariant is also missing in the or method’s while loop.
- Thus, both type invariants and detailed function specifications are not yet provided.

Dependencies:
- The BitMap struct’s mathematical abstraction depends on the “view” function.
- The various methods (from, get_bit, set_bit, or) need requires/ensures clauses.
- Proofs depend on the completed specs and possibly any derived invariants.

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
The code explicitly mentions a "view" function and requests its implementation. It also has a struct (BitMap) plus multiple "TODO: add requires/ensures," thus requiring both view and specification work. Because it is a class/struct, we include the inv_inference step.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes (the code contains a struct data structure, and we may need invariants).
- proof_generation: Yes ("TODO: add proof" exists in set_bit and or methods).
```
