### Step 1: Analyze the task

The code defines and manipulates a specialized pointer-based XOR-linked list data structure (DListXor), which stores and updates pointers in a careful memory-safe way, and includes a “view” function with a placeholder body. It needs to maintain the pointer relationships properly and show that pushes and pops preserve invariants of the doubly-linked structure. Because there is a type that stores data in a complex pointer-based representation, and a corresponding “spec fn view(&self) -> Seq<V>,” it clearly needs a full data structure abstraction. Therefore, we need to generate or refine a View function, invariant, and then generate the appropriate function specifications.

### Step 2: Choose the Workflow

**Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow  
**Explanation:** The code defines a specialized pointer-based data structure DListXor that requires a custom mathematical abstraction and invariants. Hence, we must generate and refine a View function, then synthesize invariants, and finally add specifications.
