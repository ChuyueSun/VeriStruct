## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a data structure (VecSet) with an internal Vec<u64> and a "view" function returning a mathematical Set<u64>.
- Several placeholders indicate missing specifications ("TODO: add requires and ensures") and invariants ("TODO: add invariant" in the for-loop).
- "TODO: add proof" is also present in the insert method.

Dependencies:
- The VecSet.view() function depends on the internal vt (Vec<u64>) for its set representation.
- The correctness of contains and insert relies on accurate invariants and the relationship between vt and the resulting Set<u64>.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
The code explicitly contains a “view” function for VecSet (a struct) and includes multiple specification placeholders. Because there is a need for a View implementation along with invariants and function specs, the Full Sequence Workflow is required. VecSet is a data structure, so inv_inference is included.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation  (triggered by the "TODO: add proof" and "TODO: add invariant")

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes (VecSet is a struct requiring type invariants)
- proof_generation: Yes (due to "TODO: add proof" and "TODO: add invariant")
```
