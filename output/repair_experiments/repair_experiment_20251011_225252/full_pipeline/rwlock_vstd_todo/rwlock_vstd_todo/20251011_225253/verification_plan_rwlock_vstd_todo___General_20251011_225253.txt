## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- A struct "FixedParity" implements the RwLockPredicate trait but has a placeholder "TODO: add specification" in its inv(...) function.
- The code defines a data structure that needs an invariant function (through RwLockPredicate) and also a specification to ensure correctness.
- There is no explicit requirement or TODO for defining or refining a "View" function.

Dependencies:
- "FixedParity" depends on a correct specification for inv(...) to be used inside the RwLock predicate machinery.
- RwLock correctness relies on the user-provided RwLockPredicate::inv(...) function being well-specified.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
- The code contains a struct ("FixedParity") that requires a type invariant (since it is used as a predicate for a lock).
- There is a specification placeholder ("TODO: add specification"), indicating the need for function specs.
- There is no mention of a new or refined "View" requirement, so the standard Invariant-First flow is appropriate.

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes (struct "FixedParity" is present and requires a well-formed invariant).
- proof_generation: No (no "TODO: add proof" or "TODO: add invariants" found).
```
