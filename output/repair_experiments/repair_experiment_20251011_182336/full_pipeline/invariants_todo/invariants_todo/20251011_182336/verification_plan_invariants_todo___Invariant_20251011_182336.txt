## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The "inv" function in the InvariantPredicate trait is missing its specification (marked as "TODO: add specification").
- There is no indication that a View or type invariants are required for the empty ModPredicate struct.
- The test code depends on the correctness of the "inv" function's logical predicate (e.g., requiring odd/even properties based on k).

Dependencies:
- The test function’s assertions rely on ModPredicate::inv(k, v) being correctly specified.
- No dependencies on View functions or type-invariant fields exist here.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
- There is a "TODO: add specification" placeholder but no mention or need for type invariants (the struct has no fields to enforce) and no request for a View or refinement thereof.
- Thus, we only need to infer the requires/ensures (specification) for the InvariantPredicate::inv function.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No – The struct has no fields requiring a type invariant.
- proof_generation: No – There is only a “TODO: add specification” placeholder; no “TODO: add proof” markers.
```
