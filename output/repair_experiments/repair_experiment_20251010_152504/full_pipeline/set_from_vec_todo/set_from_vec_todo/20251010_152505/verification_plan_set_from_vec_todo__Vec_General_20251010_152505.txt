## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a struct VecSet with a vector of u64 and includes a “view” function for abstracting the set as a mathematical Set<u64>.
- There are multiple TODO markers for requires/ensures, a loop invariant, and proof blocks.
- The presence of “view” in the code indicates the need for a proper View function and its refinement.

Dependencies:
- VecSet → view(&self): The data structure’s View function is necessary for formal verification of logic involving set operations.
- Functions new(), insert(), and contains() → must have their specifications (requires/ensures) in sync with the type invariants and view function.
- The loop in contains() → requires a correct loop invariant to establish correctness.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
We detect explicit reference to a “view” function (VecSet::view), which requires implementing and refining a View-based abstraction. Additionally, the code is a struct that also needs invariants. Because we have “TODO: add requires/ensures,” we must perform full verification steps involving both View inference/refinement and specification inference. The code also includes “TODO: add proof,” so we will append the proof_generation step.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference  (since VecSet is a struct)
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation  (due to “TODO: add proof”)

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – VecSet is a struct data structure requiring invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes – “TODO: add proof” is present in the insert function.
