## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a struct RingBuffer<T> with #[verifier::type_invariant] and an “impl<T: Copy> View for RingBuffer<T>” block, indicating a View is required.
- Multiple TODO placeholders indicate missing invariants, requires/ensures, and proofs.
- The presence of "View" plus the need for function specs and proofs shows a comprehensive verification effort is needed.

Identified Missing Components:
- Formal View functions for the RingBuffer struct.
- Type invariant details inside inv(&self).
- Requires/ensures clauses for multiple methods (len, has_elements, is_full, new, enqueue, dequeue, available_len).
- Proof code for the indicated “TODO: add proof” blocks.

Dependencies:
- The RingBuffer’s correctness depends on the ring, head, and tail state relationships.
- The ring’s length and wrap-around behavior must be preserved by the invariants and the methods’ specs.
- The ring-based computations must be captured in the View function and refined as needed before specifying the function behavior.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
Since the code explicitly contains a “View” implementation (“impl<T: Copy> View for RingBuffer<T>”), it requires a complete solution with the computation of a View function. The RingBuffer is also a struct, so the optional inv_inference step applies. Additionally, the presence of "TODO: add proof" triggers proof_generation at the end.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes (RingBuffer<T> is a struct requiring a type invariant).
- proof_generation: Yes (The code contains several “TODO: add proof” markers).
