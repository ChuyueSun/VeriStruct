Current State:
- The BitMap struct defines a data structure with a "bits" field of type Vec<u64>, along with functions that manipulate bits, but the "view" function is only declared as a TODO.
- Multiple functions (from, get_bit, set_bit, or) also have "TODO: Add requires and ensures" markers, indicating missing function specifications.
- There are explicit "TODO: add proof" comments (e.g., for set_bit64, bit_or_64), indicating proof obligations.
- The code clearly contains a struct requiring a View implementation.
- No invariants are defined yet, but the data structure is present, so type invariants may be needed.

Dependencies:
- The BitMap::view function depends on BitMap data and must produce a Seq<bool>.
- The functions from, get_bit, set_bit, or all need requires/ensures clauses.
- Proofs (for set_bit64, bit_or_64, and updating the BitMap) rely on verifying correct bit manipulation and correctness of the updated data structure.
- All these functions also relate to the conceptual "view" of BitMap.

Verification Plan
```
**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
The code explicitly mentions "view" requirements and has “TODO: Implement the view function”. It also has a struct (BitMap) requiring invariants and function specifications. Since there's an explicit need for a View function, we must use the Full Sequence Workflow. Because the code defines a struct, the inv_inference step is included in the chain.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes (the code defines a struct, so we generate and refine type invariants).
- proof_generation: Yes ("TODO: add proof" markers are present).
