### 1. Analysis Summary
```markdown
Current State:
- The code defines a RingBuffer struct with several methods missing their requires/ensures specifications and proofs, as indicated by multiple "TODO" markers.
- There is an explicit View implementation for RingBuffer that requires a specification, triggering the need for view functions.
- The intrinsic properties (e.g., type invariants) for the RingBuffer are left unspecified.

Dependencies:
- The RingBuffer struct requires both a View (mathematical abstraction) and an invariant (via inv_inference) to properly verify its methods.
- The functions (like len, enqueue, dequeue, etc.) depend on correct type invariants and function specifications, and they require accompanying proofs (notably where "TODO: add proof" appears).
```

### 2. Verification Plan
```markdown
**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
The code explicitly contains a "View" implementation for the RingBuffer and has placeholders indicating that View specifications must be added. Moreover, RingBuffer is a class/struct data structure that requires type invariants along with proper function specifications. In addition, multiple TODO markers ("TODO: add proof", "TODO: add requires and ensures", "TODO: add specification") confirm that both invariant and specification inference are needed.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation   // Included because "TODO: add proof" markers are present in the code

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes — needed because RingBuffer is a class/struct requiring a type invariant.
- proof_generation: Yes — "TODO: add proof" markers are found in several methods.
```
