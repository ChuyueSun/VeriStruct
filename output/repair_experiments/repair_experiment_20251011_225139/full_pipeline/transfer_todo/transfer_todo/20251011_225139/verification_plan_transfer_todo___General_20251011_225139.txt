## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code contains a struct (Account) but there is no indication that it requires a type invariant.
- The primary TODO in the code is to add "requires and ensures" for the transfer function.
- There is no mention of Views or any View-related tasks.

Dependencies:
- The transfer function depends on proper preconditions (e.g., that orig.balance ≥ amount).
- No interdependencies requiring a type invariant or a View function have been identified.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
- The only placeholder is "TODO: add requires and ensures" for the transfer function.
- There is a struct present (Account), but the code does not indicate a need for invariants or a View function.
- Hence, only function specifications are needed, fitting the Specification-Only Workflow.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No (the code does not request or require a type invariant)
- proof_generation: No (there is no "TODO: add proof" in the code)
```
