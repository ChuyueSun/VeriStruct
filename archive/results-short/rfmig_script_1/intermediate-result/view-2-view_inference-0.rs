// {"$message_type":"diagnostic","message":"type annotations needed","code":{"code":"E0282","explanation":"The compiler could not infer a type and asked for a type annotation.\n\nErroneous code example:\n\n```compile_fail,E0282\nlet x = Vec::new();\n```\n\nThis error indicates that type inference did not result in one unique possible\ntype, and extra information is required. In most cases this can be provided\nby adding a type annotation. Sometimes you need to specify a generic type\nparameter manually.\n\nIn the example above, type `Vec` has a type parameter `T`. When calling\n`Vec::new`, barring any other later usage of the variable `x` that allows the\ncompiler to infer what type `T` is, the compiler needs to be told what it is.\n\nThe type can be specified on the variable:\n\n```\nlet x: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();\n```\n\nThe type can also be specified in the path of the expression:\n\n```\nlet x = Vec::<i32>::new();\n```\n\nIn cases with more complex types, it is not necessary to annotate the full\ntype. Once the ambiguity is resolved, the compiler can infer the rest:\n\n```\nlet x: Vec<_> = \"hello\".chars().rev().collect();\n```\n\nAnother way to provide the compiler with enough information, is to specify the\ngeneric type parameter:\n\n```\nlet x = \"hello\".chars().rev().collect::<Vec<char>>();\n```\n\nAgain, you need not specify the full type if the compiler can infer it:\n\n```\nlet x = \"hello\".chars().rev().collect::<Vec<_>>();\n```\n\nApart from a method or function with a generic type parameter, this error can\noccur when a type parameter of a struct or trait cannot be inferred. In that\ncase it is not always possible to use a type annotation, because all candidates\nhave the same return type. For instance:\n\n```compile_fail,E0282\nstruct Foo<T> {\n    num: T,\n}\n\nimpl<T> Foo<T> {\n    fn bar() -> i32 {\n        0\n    }\n\n    fn baz() {\n        let number = Foo::bar();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis will fail because the compiler does not know which instance of `Foo` to\ncall `bar` on. Change `Foo::bar()` to `Foo::<T>::bar()` to resolve the error.\n"},"level":"error","spans":[{"file_name":"/var/folders/nh/_8qdng_n3357qvdjjrx5mchw0000gn/T/tmpjmokwqob","byte_start":1253,"byte_end":1262,"line_start":41,"line_end":41,"column_start":19,"column_end":28,"is_primary":false,"text":[{"text":"        old(perm).opt_value().is_Uninit(),","highlight_start":19,"highlight_end":28}],"label":"type must be known at this point","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null},{"file_name":"/var/folders/nh/_8qdng_n3357qvdjjrx5mchw0000gn/T/tmpjmokwqob","byte_start":1243,"byte_end":1246,"line_start":41,"line_end":41,"column_start":9,"column_end":12,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"        old(perm).opt_value().is_Uninit(),","highlight_start":9,"highlight_end":12}],"label":"cannot infer type of the type parameter `A` declared on the function `old`","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null}],"children":[{"message":"consider specifying the generic argument","code":null,"level":"help","spans":[{"file_name":"/var/folders/nh/_8qdng_n3357qvdjjrx5mchw0000gn/T/tmpjmokwqob","byte_start":1246,"byte_end":1246,"line_start":41,"line_end":41,"column_start":12,"column_end":12,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"        old(perm).opt_value().is_Uninit(),","highlight_start":12,"highlight_end":12}],"label":null,"suggested_replacement":"::<A>","suggestion_applicability":"HasPlaceholders","expansion":null}],"children":[],"rendered":null}],"rendered":"error[E0282]: type annotations needed\n  --> /var/folders/nh/_8qdng_n3357qvdjjrx5mchw0000gn/T/tmpjmokwqob:41:9\n   |\n41 |         old(perm).opt_value().is_Uninit(),\n   |         ^^^       --------- type must be known at this point\n   |         |\n   |         cannot infer type of the type parameter `A` declared on the function `old`\n   |\nhelp: consider specifying the generic argument\n   |\n41 |         old::<A>(perm).opt_value().is_Uninit(),\n   |            +++++\n\n"}
