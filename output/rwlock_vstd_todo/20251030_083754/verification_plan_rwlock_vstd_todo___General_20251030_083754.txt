Current State:
- The struct "FixedParity" implements the RwLockPredicate trait but lacks a completed specification ("TODO: add specification").
- The code includes both a data structure (FixedParity) and a specification placeholder but does not mention or require any View functions.

Dependencies:
- The RwLock type depends on an invariant predicate for its stored values.
- FixedParity’s inv function is needed to ensure the RwLock’s invariant is satisfied.

**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
Since FixedParity is a struct that requires type invariants and there is a "TODO: add specification" marker implying a need for requires/ensures, we use the Invariant-First Workflow. There is no mention of any View requirements, so the Full Sequence Workflow is not needed.

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes - "FixedParity" is a struct requiring a type invariant to be fully verified.
- proof_generation: No - There are no "TODO: add proof" or "TODO: add invariants" statements, so no proof generation step is added.
