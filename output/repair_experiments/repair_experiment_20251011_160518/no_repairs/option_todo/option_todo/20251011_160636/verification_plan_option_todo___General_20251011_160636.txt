Current State:
- The code contains an enum MyOption<A> with several functions missing specifications
- Multiple "TODO: add specification" and "TODO: add requires and ensures" comments are present
- There is no mention of View functions nor any request for invariants

Dependencies:
- Each function depends on appropriate preconditions (requires) and postconditions (ensures)
- No apparent need for type invariants
- No View-related feature references

```
```markdown
**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
This code contains no class/struct invariants or View function requirements. It does have placeholders strictly asking for specifications ("TODO: add specification" and "TODO: add requires/ensures"), so the Specification-Only Workflow meets these needs.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No - there is no struct/class data structure needing invariants or "TODO: add invariants"
- proof_generation: No - no "TODO: add proof" or "TODO: add invariants" comments found
```
