## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a Lock<T> struct (using struct_with_invariants!) whose well_formed function contains a TODO for adding specification.
- The take function also has TODO markers for adding requires/ensures and loop invariants.
- This indicates both type invariants (for the Lock) and function specifications are needed.

Dependencies:
- The Lock<T> struct invariant depends on the AtomicBool field’s ghost state being consistent with the Option<T> data.
- The take function’s correctness depends on loop invariants and requires/ensures clauses reflecting the lock’s well_formed invariant.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
Since there is a struct data structure (Lock<T>) that needs type invariants, and there are specification-related placeholders (“TODO: add requires/ensures”), but no mention of View functions, we use the Invariant-First Workflow. In addition, “TODO: add invariants” triggers the final proof_generation step.

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference
3. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes (Lock<T> is a struct requiring invariants).
- proof_generation: Yes (due to “TODO: add invariants”).
```
