This code defines an invariant predicate (ModPredicate) ensuring that the tracked u32 value is always odd, then creates two AtomicInvariant instances (i and j) and manipulates them by opening both invariants. After swapping the underlying tracked values, it finally into_inner()s one of them and uses an assert to confirm that the value remains odd. The code is valid Verus syntax and will verify successfully under the stated invariant.
