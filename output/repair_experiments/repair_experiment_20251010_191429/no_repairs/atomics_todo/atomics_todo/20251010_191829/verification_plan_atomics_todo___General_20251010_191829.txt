Current State:
- The code defines a Lock<T> struct with an invariant placeholder ("TODO: add specification") and a take<T> function with missing requires/ensures and loop invariants.
- There are explicit TODOs for adding both invariants and function specifications.
- No references to "View" or "View implementation" are present.

Dependencies:
- The Lock<T> struct’s invariant depends on the relationship between the boolean state and Option<T>.
- The take<T> function must rely upon that invariant and add its own loop invariant.
- Both the Lock<T> struct’s invariant and take<T> function’s specification must be proven for full verification.

**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
The code defines a struct (Lock<T>) needing type invariants and also includes "TODO: add requires and ensures," thus requiring specification. There is no mention of "View" or a need for a custom View function, so we do not choose the Full Sequence Workflow. The Invariant-Only Workflow does not apply because we do have specification placeholders. Therefore, the optimal approach is inv_inference → spec_inference. Since "TODO: add invariants" and "TODO: add specification" appear, we append proof_generation.

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference
3. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes - the Lock<T> struct requires type invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes - due to "TODO: add invariants" and "TODO: add specification."
