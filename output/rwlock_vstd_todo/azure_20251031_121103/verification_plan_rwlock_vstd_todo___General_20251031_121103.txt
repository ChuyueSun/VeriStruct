Current State:
- The code includes a data structure "FixedParity" and uses it with RwLock.
- There is a "TODO: add specification" marker in the inv() function of the RwLockPredicate trait, indicating placeholders for requires/ensures or other specification details.
- No "View" or "implement View" requirements are present, and there is no mention of needing a custom View function.

Dependencies:
- The "inv" function for FixedParity must be completed to satisfy the RwLockPredicate contract.
- The RwLock requires that any supplied predicate fulfill its specification requirements to ensure correct operation.

**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
The code has a struct ("FixedParity") which qualifies as a data structure, and there is a placeholder ("TODO: add specification") indicating the need for function specifications. There is no mention of a View function or any View-related TODO, so the Invariant-First Workflow (inv_inference → spec_inference) is appropriate.

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – the code includes the struct FixedParity and needs an invariant function consistent with the trait requirement.
- proof_generation: No – no "TODO: add proof" or "TODO: add invariants" markers are present.
