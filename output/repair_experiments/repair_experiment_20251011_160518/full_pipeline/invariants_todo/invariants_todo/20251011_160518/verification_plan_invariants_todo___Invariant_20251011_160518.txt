# 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a struct "ModPredicate" implementing the InvariantPredicate<int, u32> trait but leaves its predicate function body empty, marked with "TODO: add specification".
- The usage of AtomicInvariant in test() indicates we need to ensure the type invariants and function specifications are correct.
- There is no mention of a "View" implementation or view-related TODOs.

Dependencies:
- The "ModPredicate" struct depends on Verus's InvariantPredicate trait.
- The "test" function depends on the correctness of ModPredicate::inv for holding AtomicInvariants.

# 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
This code declares a struct data structure ("ModPredicate") that provides a predicate for invariants, indicating type invariants are needed. It also contains a specification-related TODO ("TODO: add specification") but no references to any "View" functions. Hence, the Invariant-First Workflow (inv_inference → spec_inference) is the most appropriate.

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes (we have a struct data structure that needs type invariants).
- proof_generation: No (there is no "TODO: add proof" or "TODO: add invariants" marker).
```
