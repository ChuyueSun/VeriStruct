# Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a struct "VecSet" that includes a "view" spec function, but the definition is incomplete.
- Multiple TODOs indicate missing requires/ensures clauses, missing invariants, and a needed proof block.
- The "view" function is referenced in the test via "vs@" notation, confirming a View-based abstraction is intended.

Identified Missing Components:
- A complete implementation of the "view" function.
- Type invariants for "VecSet" (e.g., loop invariants in "contains").
- Requires and ensures clauses for "new", "insert", and "contains".
- Proof statements for the correctness of insertion and membership checks.

Critical Verification Challenges:
- Constructing the correct set-based model in "view" to accurately reflect the contents of "vt".
- Ensuring the loop invariants in "contains" are sufficient to prove correctness.
- Providing the necessary ensures clauses and verifying them in "test".

Dependencies:
- "VecSet.view" is needed by all public methods to connect the concrete representation "vt" with the abstract set.
- The "test" function relies on the correctness of "view", as it uses "vs@" to assert set properties.
- Type invariants and proofs depend on the relationship between "vt" and its conceptual set representation.

# Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
Since the code explicitly contains a "view" function and references its usage (via "vs@"), a complete View-based verification is needed. Furthermore, the data structure "VecSet" requires type invariants, and there are TODO notes to add specifications and proofs. These conditions meet the requirements for the Full Sequence Workflow, including the optional invariant inference step for a struct data type.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – "VecSet" is a struct, and there are TODOs to add invariants (e.g., in the for-loop of "contains").
- proof_generation: Yes – there is a "TODO: add proof" marker in the "insert" method and a request for additional invariants.
