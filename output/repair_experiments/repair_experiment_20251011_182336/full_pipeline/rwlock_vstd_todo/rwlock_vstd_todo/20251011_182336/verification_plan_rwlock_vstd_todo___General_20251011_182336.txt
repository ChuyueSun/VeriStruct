## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The only missing piece is the body of the “inv” function in the “FixedParity” struct, marked with “TODO: add specification”.
- There is no request to add any type invariants for “FixedParity” or “RwLock” beyond what is already specified.
- No “View” or “TODO: add View” requirements are present in the code.

Dependencies:
- The “FixedParity” struct implements “RwLockPredicate<u64>”, so its “inv” method must constrain the integer argument in some way.
- The “test” function relies on “FixedParity::inv” being correct to ensure the locks store integers of the correct parity.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
- There is a placeholder “TODO: add specification” but no mention of needing type invariants for the struct data.
- There is no reference to “TODO: add view” or “implement View,” so a full sequence workflow is not required.
- “FixedParity” is a simple struct with no explicit “TODO: add invariants,” so we do not need the Invariant-First workflow.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No – the code does not request struct-level invariants beyond the existing type_invariant on “RwLock.”
- proof_generation: No – there is no “TODO: add proof” or “TODO: add invariants” in the code.
```
