## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a BST node structure (Node<V>) which requires a well_formed() invariant but currently has a “TODO: add invariant”.
- Multiple methods (insert_into_optional, insert, delete_from_optional, delete_rightmost, get_from_optional, get) have “TODO: add requires and ensures” indicating missing function specifications.
- There is no mention of an explicit View trait or need for a custom View function beyond the existing spec functions (e.g., optional_as_map).
- The code references “TODO: add invariants” which triggers the necessity for proving property correctness.

Dependencies:
- The well_formed() function underlies the type invariant for the BST property.
- The insert, delete, and get methods depend on the well_formed() invariant to preserve or check BST correctness.
- Each operation’s ensures clause must rely on the well_formed() invariant to guarantee the BST property.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
- We have a data structure (Node<V>) needing type invariants (“TODO: add invariant” in well_formed).
- We also have placeholders requesting function specifications (“TODO: add requires/ensures”), so we need to infer them.
- There is no explicit mention of “View” or “implement View” requirements, so a full sequence workflow is not needed.

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference
3. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – The Node<V> struct requires a BST property invariant.
- proof_generation: Yes – There is “TODO: add invariant” text (and function specs), indicating proofs will be required.
