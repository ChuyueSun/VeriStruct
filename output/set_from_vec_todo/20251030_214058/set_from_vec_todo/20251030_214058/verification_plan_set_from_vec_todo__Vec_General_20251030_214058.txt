### 1. Analysis Summary
```markdown
Current State:
- The code defines a struct (VecSet) with an explicit View function and several "TODO" markers for requires, ensures, proof, and invariants.
- There are missing specifications for the view function, constructor, and other methods, as well as missing invariant proofs for the loop.
- The presence of "TODO: add proof" and "TODO: add invariant" indicates incomplete verification steps.

Dependencies:
- The VecSet struct depends on a proper mathematical abstraction (through its view) for its verification.
- The function specifications (requires/ensures) and invariants are interdependent with the view, meaning that generating a correct view function will support deriving postconditions and loop invariants.
```

### 2. Verification Plan
```markdown
**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
The code explicitly contains a "View" function and related TODO markers requesting requires/ensures, which necessitate a complete verification solution including view_inference and view_refinement steps. Additionally, because VecSet is a struct, the inv_inference step is required to generate type invariants. The presence of "TODO: add proof" triggers the inclusion of the optional proof_generation step at the end.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – the input is a struct (VecSet) that requires type invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes – the code contains "TODO: add proof" and "TODO: add invariant" markers.
```
