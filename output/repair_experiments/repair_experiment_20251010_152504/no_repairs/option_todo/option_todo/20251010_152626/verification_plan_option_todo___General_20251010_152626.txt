## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines an enum MyOption<A> and includes several functions requiring specifications.
- The placeholders only mention "TODO: add specification" or "TODO: add requires and ensures."
- No invariants or View functions are referenced or requested.

Identified Missing Components:
- Requires/ensures clauses for the functions or, is_some, is_none, as_ref, and unwrap.
- Specification bodies for the open spec functions is_Some, is_None, get_Some_0, and Or.

Critical Verification Challenges:
- Ensuring function preconditions and postconditions align with the intended semantics of a MyOption type.
- Filling in open spec functions with correct logical specifications without altering the data structure.

Dependencies:
- Each function’s correctness depends on clear requires/ensures clauses.
- No user-defined type invariants or external proofs are currently required.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
Since the code does not request or require any type invariants, and no View implementation is mentioned, adding function specifications is the sole requirement. The placeholders only request "add specification" and "add requires/ensures," indicating that only spec_inference is needed.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No – the MyOption enum does not require additional invariants.
- proof_generation: No – there are no "TODO: add proof" markers present.
