## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a struct VecSet and provides a “closed spec fn view” method, clearly indicating the need for a View function.
- There are explicit “TODO: add requires and ensures” placeholders in new(), insert(), and contains() methods, signifying missing function specifications.
- There are “TODO: add proof” and “TODO: add invariant” markers, indicating missing proof blocks and invariants.

Dependencies:
- VecSet depends on its View function to properly reflect the abstract data structure (Set<u64>).
- The methods (new, insert, contains) each need specifications (requires/ensures).
- The loop in contains needs an invariant, and insert needs proof blocks to ensure correctness.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
- The code contains a struct (VecSet) and explicitly defines a “view” function, invoking the need for a View-based approach.
- Since it is a class/struct data structure requiring invariants and specifications, and it includes View references, the Full Sequence Workflow is appropriate.
- The presence of “TODO: add proof” also requires that we include a proof_generation step at the end.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – VecSet is a struct, so we infer type invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes – “TODO: add proof” and “TODO: add invariant” markers exist.
```
