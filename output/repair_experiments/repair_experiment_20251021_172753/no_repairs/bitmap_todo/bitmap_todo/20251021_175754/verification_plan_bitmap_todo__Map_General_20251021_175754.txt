Current State:
- The code defines a BitMap struct (class/struct data structure) with a spec fn view that is unimplemented.
- Multiple "TODO" markers exist for requires/ensures clauses and proofs in methods (e.g., set_bit, or).
- A loop invariant is also requested in the or method ("TODO: add loop invariant").
- Hence, both View functions, type invariants, and specifications/proofs are needed.

Dependencies:
- The BitMap.view() function (mathematical abstraction) depends on the internal Vec<u64> layout.
- Each operational method (from, get_bit, set_bit, or) depends on the required/ensures clauses plus any needed invariants and proofs.
- The proofs for set_bit and or depend on correct specifications and possibly an invariant over the bits Vec.

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
The code explicitly contains a View function ("spec fn view") that is currently unimplemented. Per the rules, any explicit View requirement triggers the Full Sequence Workflow. Since BitMap is a struct data structure, we include inv_inference; the code also has "TODO: add proof" markers, so we append proof_generation last.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes (the input is a BitMap struct, so type invariants may be required)
- proof_generation: Yes ("TODO: add proof" found in set_bit and or)
```
