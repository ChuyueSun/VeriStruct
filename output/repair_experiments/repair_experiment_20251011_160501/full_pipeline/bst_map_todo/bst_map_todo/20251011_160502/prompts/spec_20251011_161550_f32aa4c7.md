# Prompt

## System
You are a helpful AI assistant specialized in Verus formal verification.

## Instruction
You are an expert in Verus (a Rust-based verification framework). Your task is to replace every occurrence of `// TODO: add proof` or `// TODO: add invariants` with appropriate proof blocks or loop invariants that help Verus verify the program. If invariants already exist, reconsider the invariants and edit them if necessary.

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: When adding loop invariants, you MUST check Section 3's mandatory checklist and follow the patterns. Most verification failures come from missing bridge invariants or missing region invariants. DO NOT skip these checks.

Follow these guidelines carefully:

## 1. PROOF BLOCK STRUCTURE

- For regular functions (`fn` or `pub fn`): Add proof blocks using the syntax `proof { ... }`
- For proof functions (`proof fn`): Write assertions directly in the function body - DO NOT use `proof { ... }` blocks
- Each proof block should be focused and minimal, containing only what's needed

## 2. PROOF BLOCK CONTENTS

- Start with type invariant usage (if exists): For methods in `impl` blocks, begin with:
  * `use_type_invariant(&*self);` for reference receivers
  * `use_type_invariant(self);` for value receivers
- Carefully review all existing lemmas defined in the file and invoke each one that is relevant to the current proof context, using the syntax `lemma_name(arg1, arg2, ...)`.
  * For example, if there are lemmas about sequence bounds or modular arithmetic, call them as needed, such as `lemma_mod_auto(self.vt.len() as int)`.
  * For lemmas about sequence properties, use the appropriate generic syntax, e.g., `broadcast use group_seq_properties`.
  * When reasoning about sequences or specifications, ensure that all applicable modular arithmetic and sequence-related lemmas from the file are called to support your proof.
- Use assertions strategically with `assert(condition)`
- When helpful, use the `by(...)` syntax for proof steps:
  * `by(nonlinear_arith)` for arithmetic reasoning
  * `by { ... }` for explicit proof steps

## 3. LOOP INVARIANTS

**MANDATORY CHECKLIST - Answer ALL questions before writing invariants:**

1. ✓ Does the struct have a `spec fn view(&self)` or similar abstraction?
2. ✓ Is the postcondition expressed using `view()` or other spec functions?
3. ✓ Does the loop modify the concrete representation (fields, arrays)?
4. ✓ Are there function preconditions (sorted, non-negative, etc.)?
5. ✓ Does the loop process from multiple positions (two pointers, dual-end)?

**IF YES to questions 1-3:** You MUST add bridge invariants (see Section 3.2.2)
**IF YES to question 4:** You MUST inherit preconditions into invariants (see below)
**IF YES to question 5:** You MUST add invariants for ALL regions (see Section 3.3)

When adding loop invariants (marked by `// TODO: add invariants`), include:

- Identify and add invariants for EVERY variable that is READ in the loop:
  * For scalar variables (e.g., x, y)
  * For array/vector elements (e.g., x[k], v[i])
  * Include invariants about their initial values
- Identify and add invariants for EVERY variable that is WRITTEN in the loop:
  * For direct assignments (e.g., y = ...)
  * For vector/array updates (e.g., v.set(..., ...))
  * Repeat relevant invariants even if specified earlier
- Fully utilize spec functions and proof functions in the invariants

**CRITICAL: Inherit Precondition Properties into Loop Invariants**

When a loop's correctness depends on properties from the function's preconditions, those properties MUST be explicitly repeated in the loop invariants, even though they are "obviously" true from context.

**Common precondition properties to inherit:**

1. **Ordering properties**: `forall|i: int, j: int| 0 <= i <= j < array.len() ==> array[i] <= array[j]`
2. **Non-negative values**: `forall|i: int| 0 <= i < array.len() ==> array[i] >= 0`
3. **Distinct elements**: `forall|i: int, j: int| 0 <= i < j < array.len() ==> array[i] != array[j]`
4. **Bounded values**: `forall|i: int| 0 <= i < array.len() ==> array[i] < MAX_VALUE`
5. **Structural properties**: Any property about the structure of data that the algorithm relies on

**Abstract Pattern:**
```rust
fn algorithm(data: &DataStructure, target: ValueType) -> (result: ResultType)
    requires
        precondition_property_1(data),  // e.g., ordering, uniqueness, etc.
        precondition_property_2(data, target),
{
    // ... initialization ...
    while loop_condition
        invariant
            loop_bounds_invariant,
            precondition_property_1(data),  // ← MUST REPEAT preconditions!
            loop_correctness_invariant,
        decreases termination_metric
    {
        // loop body that relies on precondition_property_1
    }
}
```

**Why this matters**: Verus does not automatically assume preconditions remain true inside loops. Without explicitly stating these properties in invariants, Verus cannot use them to reason about why the loop maintains correctness (e.g., why narrowing ranges, partitioning data, or updating indices preserves desired properties).

**CRITICAL: Decreases Clauses for Loop Termination**

Every loop MUST have a `decreases` clause to prove termination:

```rust
while condition
    invariant
        // ... your invariants ...
    decreases expression  // ← REQUIRED
{
    // loop body
}
```

**Common patterns:**

1. **Incrementing counter** (`while i < n`):
   ```rust
   decreases n - i
   ```

2. **Decrementing counter** (`while i > 0`):
   ```rust
   decreases i
   ```

3. **Binary search / narrowing range** (`while i1 < i2`):
   ```rust
   decreases i2 - i1
   ```

4. **Narrowing range with != condition** (`while i1 != i2`):
   ```rust
   decreases i2 - i1  // Ensure i1 and i2 converge
   ```

5. **Complex expressions** - use the value that strictly decreases each iteration

**The decreases expression must:**
- Be non-negative (type `int` or `nat`)
- Strictly decrease on each loop iteration
- Prove the loop eventually terminates

**Key insight for narrowing range algorithms**: When maintaining a search range [i1, i2], ensure the invariant states that the target exists within the **current range** [i1, i2], not just somewhere in the entire collection. For example:
- ❌ Weak: `exists|i: int| 0 <= i < v.len() && v[i] == k`
- ✅ Strong: `exists|i: int| i1 <= i <= i2 && v[i] == k`

This ensures that when the loop exits with i1 == i2, the invariant directly proves the postcondition.

### 3.1 PATTERN: Recognizing When Bridge Invariants Are Needed

**Before writing loop invariants, check:**
1. Does the data structure have a `spec fn view(&self)` or similar abstraction function?
2. Is the postcondition expressed in terms of `view()` rather than raw fields?
3. Does the loop modify the underlying concrete representation?

**If YES to all three → You MUST add bridge invariants** (see Section 3.2.2 below)

### 3.3 CRITICAL: Multi-Region Invariants for Two-Pointer Algorithms

When an algorithm processes an array/sequence from multiple positions (e.g., from both ends, or with multiple cursors), you MUST add separate invariants for EACH region.

**Pattern: Dual-end processing (moving from both ends toward middle)**

When processing indices from both ends (e.g., `left` moving right, `right` moving left):

```rust
for cursor in 0..midpoint
    invariant
        // Bounds
        0 <= cursor <= midpoint,
        cursor <= length - cursor,
        // Region 1: Left side [0, cursor) - already processed
        forall|i: int| 0 <= i < cursor ==>
            property_holds_for_processed(v[i], original[i]),
        // Region 2: Middle [cursor, length-cursor) - not yet touched
        forall|i: int| cursor <= i < length - cursor ==>
            v[i] == original[i],
        // Region 3: Right side [length-cursor, length) - already processed  ← CRITICAL!
        forall|i: int| length - cursor <= i < length ==>
            property_holds_for_processed(v[i], original[i]),
```

**Why all three regions matter:**
- When loop exits at `cursor = midpoint`
- Left covers `[0, midpoint)`
- Middle becomes `[midpoint, midpoint)` = **empty**
- Right covers `[midpoint, length)`
- Together: **full coverage** of `[0, length)`

**Common mistake**: Forgetting the third invariant for the right/back region. Without it, Verus has no information about what happened to elements processed from the other end, causing postcondition failures.

**Pattern: Multiple cursors/partitions**

For algorithms with multiple moving boundaries (e.g., partitioning, quicksort-style):
```rust
while condition
    invariant
        // All cursor positions and their relationships
        0 <= cursor1 <= cursor2 <= cursor3 <= length,
        // Region 1: [0, cursor1) - elements with property A
        forall|i: int| 0 <= i < cursor1 ==> has_property_A(v[i]),
        // Region 2: [cursor1, cursor2) - elements with property B
        forall|i: int| cursor1 <= i < cursor2 ==> has_property_B(v[i]),
        // Region 3: [cursor2, cursor3) - elements with property C
        forall|i: int| cursor2 <= i < cursor3 ==> has_property_C(v[i]),
        // Region 4: [cursor3, length) - unprocessed
        // (may not need invariant if no property required yet)
```

**General principle**: If your algorithm creates N distinct regions during execution, you typically need N-1 to N invariants describing what's true in each region.

### 3.2 STRENGTHENING LOOP INVARIANTS FOR ARRAY ACCESS

When loops access arrays/vectors using loop variables, Verus needs strong invariants to prove bounds safety:

1. **Track array lengths explicitly**: If accessing arrays/vectors using loop variables, add:
   ```rust
   n == self.data@.len(),
   n == other.data@.len(),
   ```
   where `n` is the loop bound. This helps Verus prove `i < array.len()` at each access.

2. **Add "bridge invariants" connecting concrete and abstract representations**:

**⚠️ CRITICAL PATTERN - Most common cause of verification failure!**

If the struct has `spec fn view(&self)` and the postcondition mentions `view()`, you MUST add TWO invariants:

   When a data structure has both:
   - Concrete representation (e.g., `data: Vec<ChunkType>`)
   - Abstract specification via `spec fn view(&self) -> Seq<ElementType>`

   You MUST add invariants at BOTH levels:

   **Raw level** (concrete):
   ```rust
   forall|j: int| 0 <= j < i ==>
       result.data@[j] == combine_chunks(self.data@[j], other.data@[j])
   ```

   **Spec level** (abstract) - **REQUIRED to prove postconditions about view()**:
   ```rust
   forall|k: int| 0 <= k < i * ITEMS_PER_CHUNK ==>
       extract_from_chunks(result.data@, k) ==
       combine_elements(
           extract_from_chunks(self.data@, k),
           extract_from_chunks(other.data@, k)
       )
   ```

   **Key insight**: The spec-level invariant should use the SAME EXPRESSION as the view() function definition. This creates a direct bridge from concrete state to abstract spec, allowing Verus to prove postconditions stated in terms of view().

   Without the spec-level invariant, Verus cannot connect loop progress to postconditions about view().

   **STEP-BY-STEP RECIPE (DO THIS EVERY TIME):**

   1. **Find** the `spec fn view(&self)` definition in the struct
   2. **Copy** the exact expression used inside `Seq::new(...)`
   3. **Add raw-level invariant** (about concrete fields):
      ```rust
      forall|j: int| 0 <= j < i ==> result.data@[j] == combine(self.data@[j], other.data@[j])
      ```
   4. **Add bridge invariant** (REQUIRED - copy the view() expression):
      ```rust
      forall|k: int| 0 <= k < i * CHUNK_SIZE ==>
          expression_from_view(result.data@, k) ==
          expected_result(expression_from_view(self.data@, k),
                         expression_from_view(other.data@, k))
      ```



3. **Add proof blocks INSIDE loops**: After modifying data structures in a loop, add proof blocks to establish invariants for the new iteration:
   ```rust
   result = DataStructure { data: new_data };
   proof {
       assert forall|k: int| i * ITEMS_PER_CHUNK <= k < (i + 1) * ITEMS_PER_CHUNK implies
           result.view()[k] == expected_value(self.view()[k], other.view()[k])
       by {
           // Use relevant lemmas and properties here
       }
   }
   ```

## 4. LENGTH PRESERVATION POSTCONDITIONS

For mutation methods that modify array/vector elements but don't change the container size, explicitly add length preservation to postconditions:

**Example**: For a method that modifies `self.data[i]` but doesn't resize:
```rust
fn update_element(&mut self, index: ElementIndex, value: ElementType)
    requires
        index < old(self).view().len(),
    ensures
        self.view() == old(self).view().update(index as int, value),
        self.data@.len() == old(self).data@.len(),  // ← Add this!
```

**Why this matters**: When mutation methods are called sequentially, Verus needs to track that container lengths remain unchanged. Without explicit postconditions, Verus cannot prove that subsequent calls satisfy their preconditions.

**General pattern**: For any `&mut self` method that:
1. Accesses elements via indices
2. Does NOT call `push`, `pop`, `resize`, etc.
3. Only modifies element values

Always add: `self.container@.len() == old(self).container@.len()`

## 5. COMMON PROOF LOCATIONS

- At function start
- Before loops
- At loop start
- At loop end
- Before key operations
- After key operations

## 6. CONSTRAINTS

- DO NOT modify any code outside of proof blocks, invariant declarations, or postconditions
- You MAY add postconditions to `ensures` clauses (e.g., length preservation)
- DO NOT change function signatures (parameters, return types), types, or preconditions
- DO NOT add new functions or types
- If no TODO markers exist, return code unchanged

## 7. VERIFICATION

- Ensure all proof blocks and invariants compile under Verus
- Remove all TODO placeholders

Return the ENTIRE file with your changes – not a diff or partial snippet.



# Verus Common Knowledge

## Important Notes
- ALWAYS use parentheses whenever possible for clarity!
- Don't delete existing non-buggy `#[trigger]`!
- Don't change "unwind" to `(unwind) as bool`!
- Return the complete modified Rust code in your response without explanations.
- Keep top level docstrings at the top of the file, before `verus! {`. Do not place them after the `verus! {` declaration.
- Don't change any function signatures.

## Spec Functions
1. No Direct Method Calls:
   In a spec function, you cannot directly call instance methods such as vector.is_full().
2. Use the @ Operator:
   To invoke methods on a variable within a spec, first convert it to its specification-level representation View with @.
3. Always use vector.len() instead of vector@.len().
4. Simplify Boolean Conjunctions:
   When combining multiple conditions, avoid excessive &&&. Fewer (or well-structured) conjunctions make the spec code easier to read and debug.
5. Parentheses Usage:
   ALWAYS wrap conditions in parentheses, even for simple expressions. This makes precedence explicit and prevents errors.

## Operators
Verus extends Rust logical operators with low-precedence forms that are especially helpful in specification code:

Standard Operators: &&, ||, ==>, <==>
Low-Precedence Variants: &&& and |||

The meaning of &&& is the same as && (logical AND), and ||| is the same as || (logical OR), but with lower precedence. This allows you to write conditions in a "bulleted list" style that remains grouped in a logical manner:

```
&&& a ==> b
&&& c
&&& d <==> e && f
```

is equivalent to:

```
(a ==> b) && c && (d <==> (e && f))
```

Note:
- Implication (==>) and equivalence (<==>) bind more tightly than &&& and |||.
- Using &&&/||| can make long specifications clearer by grouping logical clauses neatly.


# Verus Match Syntax Guidelines

## Using `matches!` Macro

In Verus, the `matches!` macro must use Rust's standard macro syntax:

```rust
// CORRECT
pub open spec fn is_Some<A>(opt: MyOption<A>) -> bool {
    matches!(opt, MyOption::Some(_))
}

// INCORRECT - don't use this syntax
pub open spec fn is_Some<A>(opt: MyOption<A>) -> bool {
    matches opt {
        MyOption::Some(_) => true,
        MyOption::None => false,
    }
}
```

## Match with `arbitrary()` in Spec Functions

When writing spec functions that match on patterns with impossible/unreachable branches, use `arbitrary()` instead of `unreachable!()`:

```rust
// CORRECT
pub open spec fn get_Some_0<A>(opt: MyOption<A>) -> A
    recommends is_Some(opt)
{
    match opt {
        MyOption::Some(a) => a,
        MyOption::None => arbitrary(), // For unreachable branches in spec functions
    }
}

// INCORRECT
pub open spec fn get_Some_0<A>(opt: MyOption<A>) -> A
    recommends is_Some(opt)
{
    match opt {
        MyOption::Some(a) => a,
        MyOption::None => unreachable!(), // Don't use this in spec functions
    }
}
```

## Match in Executable Functions

For unreachable branches in executable functions, use `unreached()`:

```rust
pub fn unwrap(self) -> (a: A)
    requires
        is_Some(self),
    ensures
        a == get_Some_0(self),
{
    match self {
        MyOption::Some(a) => a,
        MyOption::None => unreached(), // For unreachable branches in exec functions
    }
}
```

## Match in Proof Functions

For unreachable branches in proof functions, use `proof_from_false()`:

```rust
pub proof fn tracked_unwrap(tracked self) -> (tracked a: A)
    requires
        is_Some(self),
    ensures
        a == get_Some_0(self),
{
    match self {
        MyOption::Some(a) => a,
        MyOption::None => proof_from_false(), // For unreachable branches in proof functions
    }
}
```


# Verus Map Knowledge

## CRITICAL: Extensional Equality (=~=) for Maps ⚠️

**ALWAYS use `=~=` for comparing Map types in specifications:**

- ✅ **CORRECT**: `map1 =~= map2`
- ❌ **WRONG**: `map1 == map2`

**Why**: `=~=` is extensional equality that Verus reasons about effectively. Using `==` for maps will often fail verification even when the maps are logically equal.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

```rust
// ❌ WRONG - will fail verification:
ensures self.as_map() == old(self).as_map().insert(key, value)
ensures result_map == original_map.remove(key)
ensures my_map_fn(*data) == my_map_fn(*old(data)).update(...)

// ✅ CORRECT - will verify:
ensures self.as_map() =~= old(self).as_map().insert(key, value)
ensures result_map =~= original_map.remove(key)
ensures my_map_fn(*data) =~= my_map_fn(*old(data)).update(...)
```

### Examples in Different Contexts

```rust
// In struct methods with View
impl<K, V> MyMap<K, V> {
    pub fn insert(&mut self, key: K, value: V)
        ensures
            self@ =~= old(self)@.insert(key, value)  // ✅ Use =~=
}

// In helper functions
fn update_mapping<K, V>(map: &mut Map<K, V>, key: K, value: V)
    ensures
        *map =~= old(map).insert(key, value)  // ✅ Use =~=

// In functions with custom map conversions
fn modify_structure<T>(data: &mut SomeType<T>, key: u64, value: T)
    ensures
        data.to_map() =~= old(data).to_map().insert(key, value)  // ✅
```

---

## Map<K, V> - Mathematical Map Type

Map<K, V> is a mathematical map type used in specifications:

### Construction
- `Map::empty()` - Create empty map
- `Map::new(...)` - Create map (if supported)

### Operations (Return New Map)
- `map.insert(key, value)` - Returns new map with key→value added/updated
- `map.remove(key)` - Returns new map with key removed (if it existed)
- `map.union_prefer_right(other)` - Union of two maps, preferring values from right on conflicts

### Queries
- `map[key]` - Get value for key (requires key exists in domain)
- `map.dom()` - Returns `Set<K>` of all keys in the map
- `map.dom().contains(key)` - Check if key exists in map

### Common Patterns

#### Checking Key Existence
```rust
// Check if key exists
if map.dom().contains(key) {
    let value = map[key];  // Safe - key is in domain
}

// In specifications
requires map.dom().contains(key)
ensures result == map[key]
```

#### Map Updates in Postconditions
```rust
// Insertion
ensures self@ =~= old(self)@.insert(key, value)

// Deletion
ensures self@ =~= old(self)@.remove(key)

// Conditional update
ensures
    if condition {
        self@ =~= old(self)@.insert(key, new_value)
    } else {
        self@ =~= old(self)@
    }
```

#### Map Equality Assertions
```rust
// In proof blocks
assert(map1 =~= map2);  // ✅ Correct

// In ensures
ensures
    map1 =~= map2,
    map1.dom() == map2.dom(),  // Set equality uses ==
```

### Key-Value Relationships
```rust
// Accessing values
ensures
    result_map.dom().contains(key) ==> result_map[key] == value

// Comparing with original
ensures
    forall |k| result_map.dom().contains(k) ==>
        result_map[k] == original_map[k]
```

---

## Important Notes

### Equality Operators Summary

| Type | Equality Operator | Example |
|------|------------------|---------|
| **Map<K, V>** | `=~=` | `map1 =~= map2` |
| **Seq<T>** | `=~=` | `seq1 =~= seq2` |
| **Set<T>** | `==` or `=~=` | Both work for sets |
| **Primitive types** | `==` | `x == y` |
| **Struct fields** | `==` | `self.field == value` |

### When to Use Each

- **`=~=`**: Use for Map, Seq, and other collection types in specifications
- **`==`**: Use for primitive types, booleans, integers, and struct field comparisons

### Common Verification Failures

If you see "postcondition not satisfied" with map comparisons:
1. Check if you used `==` instead of `=~=`
2. Verify the map operations (insert/remove) are correct
3. Ensure all required keys are in the domain

---

## Complete Example: Data Structure with Map Representation

```rust
// Generic example (not specific to any benchmark)
pub struct MyDataStructure<K, V> {
    // ... internal fields ...
}

impl<K, V> MyDataStructure<K, V> {
    // Specification function that converts structure to map
    pub spec fn to_map(self) -> Map<K, V> {
        // ... conversion logic ...
    }

    pub fn insert(&mut self, key: K, value: V)
        requires
            old(self).well_formed(),
        ensures
            self.well_formed(),
            self.to_map() =~= old(self).to_map().insert(key, value)  // ✅ Use =~=
    {
        // ... implementation ...
    }

    pub fn remove(&mut self, key: K)
        requires
            old(self).well_formed(),
        ensures
            self.well_formed(),
            self.to_map() =~= old(self).to_map().remove(key)  // ✅ Use =~=
    {
        // ... implementation ...
    }

    pub fn get(&self, key: K) -> (result: Option<&V>)
        requires
            self.well_formed(),
        ensures
            result == (if self.to_map().dom().contains(key) {
                Some(&self.to_map()[key])
            } else {
                None
            })
    {
        // ... implementation ...
    }
}
```

**Key Point**: All insert/remove operations use `=~=` to compare map states before and after!

## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code includes a TreeMap and Node data structure that implement BST properties.
- The TreeMap implements a "View" trait, but its view function has a "TODO: add specification" placeholder.
- Several functions (insert, delete, get, etc.) have missing requires/ensures clauses.
- There is at least one "TODO: add proof" marker indicating that proof obligations are also missing.

Identified Missing Components:
- View specification bodies for TreeMap's "view" function.
- Requires/ensures clauses for TreeMap and Node methods like "insert", "delete", "get".
- Proof blocks for "TODO: add proof".

Critical Verification Challenges:
- Ensuring that BST invariants are preserved at each step of insert/delete.
- Verifying that the "view" implementation is correct and well-formed with respect to the data structure’s map abstraction.
- Properly specifying key function behaviors using requires/ensures.

Dependencies:
- The TreeMap’s as_map() relies on Node’s as_map() and optional_as_map() to correctly represent the BST as a Map.
- The user’s "view" function must match the TreeMap’s as_map() to remain consistent with the data type abstraction.
- Insertion and deletion correctness depend on the BST well_formed() invariant in Node.

---

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
The code explicitly mentions and implements a "View" trait for the TreeMap, which requires a complete view-based verification sequence. Additionally, the data structure is a BST (a struct/class-based type), so inv_inference is applicable. There are also placeholders for added proofs and function specifications, which justifies a fully comprehensive approach.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – the input is a struct (TreeMap/Node) with a BST invariant.
- proof_generation: Yes – there is a "TODO: add proof" marker in the code.
```
