# Prompt

## System
You are a helpful AI assistant specialized in Verus formal verification.

## Instruction

You are a highly experienced expert in Verus (the verifier for Rust). Your task is to refine the "View" function within the given Verus file. The "View" function is the mathematical abstraction for a data structure, capturing the minimal information needed for its specification in Verus.

It is perfectly acceptable to leave the code unchanged if the current abstraction is already appropriate; modify the "View" function only when necessary.

Your responsibilities:
  1. Analyze the current "View" function to determine if its tuple (or other structure) adequately represents the module.
  2. Evaluate whether the abstraction can be improved. (Hint: If the tuple is identical to the internal fields, that is likely not an ideal abstraction.)
  3. Modify only the "View" function to improve its abstraction while leaving all other parts of the file unchanged.
  4. Any refined view must convey at least the same amount of information while being more succinct. Aim to use a flattened tuple that is shorter than the original.
  5. **IMPORTANT**: Do not remove any "// TODO" markers in the code. Preserve all TODO comments exactly as they appear.
  6. Return the **entire updated Verus file** with your refined "View" function (or the original file if no changes were necessary) and nothing else changed.

Please provide only the complete Rust code of the file with no additional commentary.


# Verus Common Knowledge

## Important Notes
- ALWAYS use parentheses whenever possible for clarity!
- Don't delete existing non-buggy `#[trigger]`!
- Don't change "unwind" to `(unwind) as bool`!
- Return the complete modified Rust code in your response without explanations.
- Keep top level docstrings at the top of the file, before `verus! {`. Do not place them after the `verus! {` declaration.
- Don't change any function signatures.

## Spec Functions
1. No Direct Method Calls:
   In a spec function, you cannot directly call instance methods such as vector.is_full().
2. Use the @ Operator:
   To invoke methods on a variable within a spec, first convert it to its specification-level representation View with @.
3. Always use vector.len() instead of vector@.len().
4. Simplify Boolean Conjunctions:
   When combining multiple conditions, avoid excessive &&&. Fewer (or well-structured) conjunctions make the spec code easier to read and debug.
5. Parentheses Usage:
   ALWAYS wrap conditions in parentheses, even for simple expressions. This makes precedence explicit and prevents errors.

## Operators
Verus extends Rust logical operators with low-precedence forms that are especially helpful in specification code:

Standard Operators: &&, ||, ==>, <==>
Low-Precedence Variants: &&& and |||

The meaning of &&& is the same as && (logical AND), and ||| is the same as || (logical OR), but with lower precedence. This allows you to write conditions in a "bulleted list" style that remains grouped in a logical manner:

```
&&& a ==> b
&&& c
&&& d <==> e && f
```

is equivalent to:

```
(a ==> b) && c && (d <==> (e && f))
```

Note:
- Implication (==>) and equivalence (<==>) bind more tightly than &&& and |||.
- Using &&&/||| can make long specifications clearer by grouping logical clauses neatly.


# Verus View Function Guidelines

## View Refinement Guidelines
1. A good View abstraction should:
   - Represent the essential state of the data structure, not just copy its fields
   - Hide implementation details while preserving behavior
   - Be as simple as possible while being complete

2. Common refinements:
   - For collections (arrays, lists): Use Seq<T> instead of raw arrays
   - For indices: Use meaningful representations (e.g., range of valid elements)
   - For flag fields: Consider if they can be derived from other state

3. Avoid redundancy:
   - Only include fields necessary for specification
   - Derive computable properties in method ensures clauses, not in the view

4. Prefer mathematical types over concrete types when possible


# Verus Match Syntax Guidelines

## Using `matches!` Macro

In Verus, the `matches!` macro must use Rust's standard macro syntax:

```rust
// CORRECT
pub open spec fn is_Some<A>(opt: MyOption<A>) -> bool {
    matches!(opt, MyOption::Some(_))
}

// INCORRECT - don't use this syntax
pub open spec fn is_Some<A>(opt: MyOption<A>) -> bool {
    matches opt {
        MyOption::Some(_) => true,
        MyOption::None => false,
    }
}
```

## Match with `arbitrary()` in Spec Functions

When writing spec functions that match on patterns with impossible/unreachable branches, use `arbitrary()` instead of `unreachable!()`:

```rust
// CORRECT
pub open spec fn get_Some_0<A>(opt: MyOption<A>) -> A
    recommends is_Some(opt)
{
    match opt {
        MyOption::Some(a) => a,
        MyOption::None => arbitrary(), // For unreachable branches in spec functions
    }
}

// INCORRECT
pub open spec fn get_Some_0<A>(opt: MyOption<A>) -> A
    recommends is_Some(opt)
{
    match opt {
        MyOption::Some(a) => a,
        MyOption::None => unreachable!(), // Don't use this in spec functions
    }
}
```

## Match in Executable Functions

For unreachable branches in executable functions, use `unreached()`:

```rust
pub fn unwrap(self) -> (a: A)
    requires
        is_Some(self),
    ensures
        a == get_Some_0(self),
{
    match self {
        MyOption::Some(a) => a,
        MyOption::None => unreached(), // For unreachable branches in exec functions
    }
}
```

## Match in Proof Functions

For unreachable branches in proof functions, use `proof_from_false()`:

```rust
pub proof fn tracked_unwrap(tracked self) -> (tracked a: A)
    requires
        is_Some(self),
    ensures
        a == get_Some_0(self),
{
    match self {
        MyOption::Some(a) => a,
        MyOption::None => proof_from_false(), // For unreachable branches in proof functions
    }
}
```


# Verus Sequence Knowledge

Seq<T> is a mathematical sequence type used in specifications:

- Building: Seq::empty(), seq![x, y, z], Seq::singleton(x)
- Length: s.len()
- Indexing: s[i] (0-based)
- Subrange: s.subrange(lo, hi) gives elements from index lo (inclusive) to hi (exclusive)
- Concatenation: s1 + s2
- Update: s.update(i, v) returns a new sequence with index i updated to value v
- Contains: s.contains(v) checks if v is in the sequence
- Push/pop: s.push(v), s.pop() (returns new sequence, doesn't modify original)
- Equality: Use `=~=` for sequence equality, NOT `==` (e.g., `seq1 =~= seq2`, `self@.0 =~= old(self)@.0.subrange(1, (old(self)@.0.len()) as int)`)

You can use forall or exists for properties over sequences.

## Subrange Usage

1. Cast indices to `int`: `self.head as int`, not just `self.head`
2. Use `.subrange(start, end)`, not `seq[start..end]`
3. Wrap complex expressions: `(..).subrange((expression) as int, ...)`
4. For full length: `(sequence.len()) as int`

## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a RingBuffer struct that implements the "View" trait but has no actual View function provided (marked “TODO: add specification”).
- Several methods in RingBuffer have “TODO: add requires and ensures” and “TODO: add proof” placeholders, indicating missing specification and proof content.
- The ring buffer also has a “type_invariant” but no invariant body is defined (marked “TODO: add specification”).
- No verification errors are explicitly listed, but the code is incomplete and cannot be fully verified due to missing components.

Dependencies:
- The RingBuffer struct is central: it requires a View function for its abstract model, type invariants, and function specifications.
- Each public method (len, has_elements, is_full, new, enqueue, dequeue, available_len) has specification and proof placeholders that depend on both the struct’s invariant and its View function.
- The proofs within these methods will need the completed invariant and View definitions in order to verify correctness.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
- The code explicitly contains "impl<T: Copy> View for RingBuffer<T>", so a View implementation is required.
- The code includes a struct (RingBuffer) with a “type_invariant” annotation and “TODO: add specification” for its fields and methods.
- Function specifications (“requires” and “ensures”) are also requested for multiple methods, and there are “TODO: add proof” comments indicating the need for proof blocks.
- Because of the explicit “View” trait and a struct requiring type invariants, the Full Sequence Workflow applies: view_inference → view_refinement → inv_inference → spec_inference, plus a final proof_generation step to address the “TODO: add proof”.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes (we have a RingBuffer struct with a type_invariant annotation)
- proof_generation: Yes (“TODO: add proof” markers appear throughout the code)
