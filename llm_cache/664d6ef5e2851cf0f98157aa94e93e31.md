# Prompt

## Instruction
Your mission is to fix the type annotation error for the following code. Typically, this involves adding an explicit type parameter to `None`, for example:

    ret == None::<T>

(where `T` is the correct type inferred from the context). If you are not certain, do your best to infer the type from nearby definitions, function signatures, or variable usage.

Respond with the **fixed Rust code only** and do not include any explanation.

IMPORTANT:
1. Don't change the anything in immutable function(s): . Instead, consider adjusting the preconditions or postconditions of other functions or methods.
2. Don't delete existing non-buggy `#[trigger]`, `use` statements, main function.


## Query
Type annotation needed:
```
            other@ == old(other)@,
```

Code
```
#[allow(unused_imports)]
use vstd::prelude::*;

verus! {

fn main() { }

fn fixed_function(other: Ghost<u64>)
    ensures
        other@ == old(other@)
{
}

}```
