Current State:
- The code defines a single struct (Account) holding a u64 balance.
- There is a “TODO: add requires and ensures” comment for the transfer function.
- No mention of required type invariants or View functions.

Dependencies:
- The function transfer depends on appropriate function specifications (requires and ensures).
- The struct Account does not appear to require any custom invariants beyond the built-in properties of u64.

```

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
Since there is a struct but no “TODO: add invariants” or invariant requirements, and the only placeholder is “TODO: add requires and ensures,” the code only needs function specifications. There is no reference to any View requirement or mention of invariants needing definition, so the Specification-Only Workflow is the most appropriate.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No – the code does not indicate a need for type invariants.
- proof_generation: No – there are no “TODO: add proof” or “TODO: add invariants” markers requiring final proofs.
```
