## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code implements a TreeMap and Node structs for a BST (Binary Search Tree) with a custom View trait.
- There are multiple "TODO: add specification" markers (e.g. in as_map and view) and a "TODO: add proof" marker in insert.
- The existing BST property depends on the well_formed methods and the type_invariant attribute.
- Several functions (e.g., insert, delete, get) currently have no requires/ensures clauses.

Identified Missing Components:
- View function specifications for the as_map method and the view method.
- Requires/ensures clauses for the public methods (e.g., new, insert, delete, get) and related helper functions.
- Proof blocks for correctness (e.g. “// TODO: add proof” in insert).

Critical Verification Challenges:
- Maintaining the BST invariants and well-formedness across all insert/delete operations.
- Properly specifying the view of the TreeMap to enable verification of correctness at the Map abstraction level.
- Generating a complete proof for correctness and ensuring full coverage of the BST properties in the presence of optional children.

Dependencies:
- The AST of Node and TreeMap depends on the well_formed property to assert BST correctness.
- The correctness of the TreeMap methods relies on the type_invariant attribute for well_formed.
- The view-based specifications rely on a consistent mapping (as_map) for the BST.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
- The code explicitly implements a “View” trait for TreeMap (i.e., “impl<V> View for TreeMap<V>”).
- There are placeholders (“TODO: add specification”) for the View function.
- Since the code also has a struct data structure (TreeMap, Node) and references a type invariant, we include the inv_inference step.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes — the code is a struct-based data structure with BST invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes — there is at least one “TODO: add proof” present in the insert function.
```
