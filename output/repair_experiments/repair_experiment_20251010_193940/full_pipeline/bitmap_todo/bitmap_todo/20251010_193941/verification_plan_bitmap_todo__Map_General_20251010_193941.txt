Current State:
- A struct BitMap is defined, and it explicitly has a spec fn view that is yet to be implemented ("TODO: implement view").
- There are TODOs requesting function specifications ("TODO: add requires and ensures") and also a proof placeholder ("TODO: add proof").
- Thus, the code is a data structure with an explicit View requirement and missing specifications and proofs.

Dependencies:
- The BitMap struct’s functions depend on the correctness of the view() function for their specifications.
- The test function relies on correctly specified and proven set_bit and get_bit behavior.
- Proofs also depend on the final shape of the view function and any invariants.

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
This code explicitly contains a "view" function for the BitMap type and has TODO placeholders for specification and proofs. According to the rules, any code mentioning a required "View" implementation triggers the Full Sequence Workflow. Because BitMap is a struct, we also incorporate the inv_inference step. Finally, a "TODO: add proof" line is present, so we append proof_generation at the end.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes - the input BitMap is a struct needing invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes - because there is a "TODO: add proof" placeholder.
```
