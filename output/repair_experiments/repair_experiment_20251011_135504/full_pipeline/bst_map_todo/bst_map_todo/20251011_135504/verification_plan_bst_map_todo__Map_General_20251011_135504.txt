## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines two data structures, Node<V> and TreeMap<V>, which store BST-like data.
- It explicitly implements the View trait, requiring a view function mapping TreeMap<V> to Map<u64, V>.
- Many functions have “TODO: add requires and ensures” or “TODO: add specification.”
- There is also a “TODO: add proof” comment that indicates a final proof generation step is needed.

Identified Missing Components:
- View function body for TreeMap<V>.
- Requires/ensures clauses for multiple methods.
- Proof blocks to fulfill “TODO: add proof.”

Critical Verification Challenges:
- Ensuring the BST invariant is correctly enforced for all operations.
- Generating appropriate specifications and proofs consistent with the well_formed type invariant.

Dependencies:
- The type invariant well_formed depends on Node<V>::well_formed for validity.
- The “view” function must correctly map TreeMap to its Map representation.
- Functions that manipulate TreeMap must preserve well_formed and maintain the correct view.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
- The code explicitly uses the “View” trait in "impl<V> View for TreeMap<V>," requiring a view function.
- The TreeMap is a data structure, thus we must include the inv_inference step for its type invariants.
- The presence of “TODO: add specification” and “TODO: add proof” means we need specification inference plus an eventual proof_generation step.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – There is a struct TreeMap<V> with a type_invariant that needs refinement.
- proof_generation: Yes – “TODO: add proof” is present in the insert method of TreeMap<V>.
