## 1) Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a struct (Lock) via "struct_with_invariants!" which indicates a need for type invariants.
- The function "take" has "TODO: add requires and ensures," confirming that function specifications are also needed.
- There are "TODO: add invariants" markers within the loop, indicating a need for proof blocks of loop invariants.
- No explicit mentions of "View" or "implement View" appear in the code.

Dependencies:
- The Lock<T> struct and its well_formed invariant function must be completed before finalizing function specs for "take."
- The loop invariants in "take" depend on the structure's invariants and the function specifications.

## 2) Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
Since the code includes a struct needing type invariants (Lock<T>) and also has placeholders for requires/ensures, it matches the criteria for the Invariant-First Workflow. There are no View requirements in the code, so the Full Sequence Workflow is not necessary.

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference
3. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – because Lock<T> is a struct that requires invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes – the code contains "TODO: add invariants," which triggers an additional proof_generation step.
