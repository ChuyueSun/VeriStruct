Current State:
- The code defines a RingBuffer<T> data structure with a “View” implementation block, but the View is not fully specified.
- There are multiple “TODO” markers requesting invariants, specifications (requires/ensures), and proofs.
- The data structure has a type invariant but it’s also marked “TODO: add specification”.
- No explicit functional specifications for methods (e.g., requires/ensures) have been provided, and proof blocks are empty.

Dependencies:
- The View block depends on how the RingBuffer is mathematically modeled (View function).
- Type invariants of RingBuffer depend on the ring Vec<T>, head, and tail fields.
- Each method’s correctness depends on a combination of the type invariants and the function’s requires/ensures clauses.
- Proof blocks depend on the established specs and invariants.

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
The code explicitly implements “View” for RingBuffer<T>, which triggers the Full Sequence Workflow. Additionally, RingBuffer is a data structure requiring invariants, so inv_inference is included. “TODO: add proof” markers also appear, indicating a final proof_generation step.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes (RingBuffer<T> is a struct that needs type invariants).
- proof_generation: Yes (the code contains “TODO: add proof” and invariant placeholders).
