Current State:
- The code defines a struct Lock<T> with invariants and includes placeholders for function specifications ("TODO: add requires and ensures") and loop invariants ("TODO: add invariants").
- No explicit "View" or view-related requirements are present.
- A data structure Lock<T> requiring type invariants is identified, and multiple specification markers are present.

Dependencies:
- The Lock<T> struct’s invariants must be properly defined and maintained in well_formed.
- The function take<T> includes specification needs (requires/ensures) and loop invariants, implying both specs and invariants must be addressed.

**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
The code contains a struct (Lock<T>) indicating a need for invariants, and there are clear "TODO: add requires and ensures" markers. No "View" or view-related TODOs are present, so the Full Sequence Workflow is not needed. Thus, the Invariant-First Workflow is appropriate.

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference
3. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes — Lock<T> is a data structure requiring invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes — the code has "TODO: add invariants," triggering proof_generation in the final step.
```
