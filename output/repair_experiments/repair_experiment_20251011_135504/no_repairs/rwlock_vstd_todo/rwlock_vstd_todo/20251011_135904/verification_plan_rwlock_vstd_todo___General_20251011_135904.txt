## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- There is a struct "FixedParity" implementing the trait "RwLockPredicate", but its "inv" method is left with a "TODO: add specification".
- This indicates missing function-level specifications to properly define the behavior of the "inv" function.
- The code is otherwise structured around the RwLock framework, with no explicit requests to implement a custom "View" function.

Dependencies:
- The correctness of "FixedParity::inv" is essential for ensuring that values stored via RwLock satisfy the intended parity property.
- The test code and the RwLock library both depend on this predicate to verify argument correctness.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
Since the code contains a struct ("FixedParity") needing a definition of its logical conditions (an invariant-like specification) and we have a specification-related placeholder ("TODO: add specification"), but no explicit requirement to implement or refine a "View" function, the Invariant-First Workflow is appropriate. The code qualifies as a data structure and requires both invariants and function specifications.

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – "FixedParity" is a struct requiring its invariant function to be inferred.
- proof_generation: No – there are no "TODO: add proof" or "TODO: add invariants" markers in the code.
