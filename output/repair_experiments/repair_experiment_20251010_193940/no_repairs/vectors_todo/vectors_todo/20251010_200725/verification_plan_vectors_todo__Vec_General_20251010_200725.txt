## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code consists of several functions (binary_search, reverse, binary_search_no_spinoff) operating on a standard Vec<u64>.
- Each function has "TODO: add specification" to require formal requires/ensures clauses.
- There are also "TODO: add invariants" markers for the loops, but these refer to loop invariants rather than type invariants.
- No user-defined structs or classes exist, so there is no need for type invariants or View functions.

Dependencies:
- The primary dependency is that each function needs suitable requires/ensures clauses.
- The code’s correctness also depends on adding and proving the necessary loop invariants.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
- The code contains "TODO: add specification" placeholders without defining any user-defined struct/class.
- There are no "View" requirements, so we do not need the Full Sequence Workflow.
- Because no type invariants are required for user-defined data structures, we do not use an invariant-based workflow.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference
2. proof_generation  (added because "TODO: add invariants" markers are present)

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No (no user-defined data structure requiring type invariants)
- proof_generation: Yes (due to "TODO: add invariants" in the code)
```
