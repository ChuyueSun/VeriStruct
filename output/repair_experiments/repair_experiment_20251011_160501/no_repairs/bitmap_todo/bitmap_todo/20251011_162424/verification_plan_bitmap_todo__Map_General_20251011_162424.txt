Current State:
- This code defines a “BitMap” struct (a data structure) with a stubbed-out “view” function indicating a need for a View abstraction.
- Several functions need requires/ensures clauses and mention “TODO: add proof” steps.
- A loop invariant is also requested in “or” function (“TODO: add loop invariant”).
- Hence, both View-related steps and invariant/specification steps are required.

Dependencies:
- The “view” method depends on accurately retrieving bits from internal “bits: Vec<u64>” to produce a Seq<bool>.
- The correctness of the bitwise operations (get_bit, set_bit, or) depends on appropriate function specs (requires/ensures) and proofs.
- Proof generation depends on the newly introduced specs and invariants.

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
The code explicitly requires a “View” function (“TODO: implement view”) and also needs function specifications (“TODO: add requires and ensures”). Because BitMap is a struct, we must infer invariants too. Finally, there are “TODO: add proof” directives, so we must append proof_generation.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – BitMap is a struct data structure, so type invariants should be inferred.
- proof_generation: Yes – “TODO: add proof” and “TODO: add loop invariant” exist.
```
