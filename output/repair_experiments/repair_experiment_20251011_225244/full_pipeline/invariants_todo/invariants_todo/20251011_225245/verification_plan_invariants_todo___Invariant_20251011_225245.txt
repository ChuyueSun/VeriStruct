Current State:
- The code defines a struct “ModPredicate” which implements the “InvariantPredicate” trait.
- The “inv” function is missing its specification ("// TODO: add specification").
- The code uses AtomicInvariant<int, u32, ModPredicate> which indicates a need for type invariants.
- No “View” definition or any “TODO: add View” references are present.

Dependencies:
- “ModPredicate::inv(k, v)” underlies the correctness of the AtomicInvariant usage.
- The overall correctness of functions using AtomicInvariant depends on the invariant predicate.

**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
The code contains a struct (ModPredicate) that requires invariants (via InvariantPredicate) and includes a "TODO: add specification" placeholder for the inv function. There is no mention of or requirement for a View, so the Full Sequence Workflow is not applicable. The presence of a struct needing invariants plus a specification placeholder indicates the Invariant-First Workflow (inv_inference → spec_inference).

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes (struct data structure implementing a trait that requires invariants)
- proof_generation: No (no "TODO: add proof" or "TODO: add invariants" found)
```
