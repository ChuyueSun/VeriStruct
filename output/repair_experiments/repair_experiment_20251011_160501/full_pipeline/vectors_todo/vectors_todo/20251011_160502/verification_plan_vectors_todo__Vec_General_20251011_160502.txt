## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code consists of functions (binary_search, reverse, binary_search_no_spinoff) needing specifications and loop invariants.
- No new data structures (classes/structs) are introduced, so there is no need for type invariants.
- Multiple "TODO: add specification" markers indicate missing requires/ensures clauses.
- Multiple "TODO: add invariants" markers indicate missing loop invariants.

Dependencies:
- The functions themselves depend on sufficiently strong specifications to prove correctness.
- The loops in each function need proper loop invariants to enable verification.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
No struct/class data structures were found, so inv_inference does not apply. There are explicit "TODO: add specification" markers but no references to "View" functions. Therefore, the Specification-Only Workflow is appropriate. The presence of "TODO: add invariants" requires an additional proof_generation step.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference
2. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No – There is no class/struct data structure requiring a type invariant.
- proof_generation: Yes – Because "TODO: add invariants" exists, indicating the need for proofs of loop correctness.
