## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The enum MyOption<A> defines an option-like data structure with several methods.
- Many methods (is_Some, is_None, get_Some_0, Or, or, is_some, is_none, as_ref, unwrap) have "TODO: add specification" or "TODO: add requires and ensures".
- There are no "TODO: add invariants" or view-related placeholders.
- No invariant conditions appear necessary for this enum, and it does not explicitly require a View function.

Dependencies:
- Methods that need specifications are all within MyOption and its associated impl block.
- These specification placeholders do not depend on any other proofs or type invariants.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
This code does not explicitly mention or require a "View" implementation. It also has no invariants to define for the MyOption enum. The only placeholders refer to "add specification" or "add requires/ensures", so the Specification-Only Workflow is appropriate.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No (no class/struct invariants or "TODO: add invariants" present)
- proof_generation: No (no "TODO: add proof" markers found)
```
