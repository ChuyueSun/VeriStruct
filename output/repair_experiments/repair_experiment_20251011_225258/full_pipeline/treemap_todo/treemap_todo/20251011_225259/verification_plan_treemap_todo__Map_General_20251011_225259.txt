Current State:
- The TreeMap struct is defined with a type_invariant but still requires formal specifications (“TODO: add specification”) and function pre/post conditions (“TODO: add requires and ensures”).
- The code explicitly implements a View trait for TreeMap, indicating a need for verifying the custom view function.
- A proof block is partially sketched (“TODO: add proof”).

Dependencies:
- The Node module provides BST operations; TreeMap depends on these Node methods for insertion, deletion, and lookup.
- The TreeMap’s type invariant (well_formed) relies on node.well_formed() for correctness.
- The proof within insert() depends on confirming well_formed invariants, and each public method depends on correct specification clauses.

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
This code explicitly contains a "View" implementation (impl View for TreeMap) and needs function specifications, so the Full Sequence Workflow is required. A type_invariant is also present, indicating a struct data structure that needs inv_inference. Additionally, there are "TODO: add proof" tags requiring proof_generation at the end.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – TreeMap is a struct with a type_invariant requirement.
- proof_generation: Yes – “TODO: add proof” is present in the code.
