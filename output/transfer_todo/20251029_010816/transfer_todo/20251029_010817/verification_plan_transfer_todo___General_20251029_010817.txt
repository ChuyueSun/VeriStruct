## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The function "transfer" lacks the required specification (requires/ensures clauses).
- There is a struct "Account" with a "balance" field of type u64, but no invariants are explicitly requested or hinted at.
- There is a TODO marker specifically mentioning "requires and ensures" for the "transfer" function.

Identified Missing Components:
- Proper function specification for "transfer" covering preconditions (e.g., sufficient balance, no overflow) and postconditions (e.g., correct updated balances).

Critical Verification Challenges:
- Ensuring no underflow or overflow occurs in the balance adjustments.
- Providing the correct requires/ensures for "transfer" so that formal verification can succeed.

Dependencies:
- The "transfer" function depends on correctness of argument constraints and effects on "Account" balances.
- The test function ("test") calls "transfer" and relies on its correct specification and behavior.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
- There is a single "TODO: add requires and ensures" with no mention of invariants or view functions.
- The code includes a struct but does not explicitly require type invariants.
- No references to "View" or "TODO: add View," so we do not invoke view-related modules.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No (no explicit invariant-related TODOs or evidence that invariants are required)
- proof_generation: No (no "TODO: add proof" or "TODO: add invariants" found)
