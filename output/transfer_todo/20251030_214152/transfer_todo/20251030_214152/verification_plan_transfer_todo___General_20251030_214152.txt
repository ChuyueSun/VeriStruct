Current State:
- The verus code defines a struct (Account) and contains a function (transfer) that currently lacks explicit requires/ensures specifications.
- The TODO marker "TODO: add requires and ensures" indicates that the function transfer needs specification clauses.
- There is no explicit requirement for a View function, and there are no view-related TODO markers.

Dependencies:
- The Account struct is used in transfer and test functions, so its potential invariants (if needed) might play a role in verifying transfer.
- The correctness of transfer depends on the proper specification (requires/ensures) that relates the Account balances before and after the operation.

**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
The input contains a struct (Account), which qualifies as a class/struct data structure that might have associated invariants. Additionally, the presence of the "TODO: add requires and ensures" placeholder on the transfer function indicates a need for specification inference. Since there is no explicit requirement for a View implementation, the Invariant-First Workflow (inv_inference → spec_inference) is appropriate.

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – The input is a class/struct data structure (Account) and may benefit from automatically inferred invariants.
- proof_generation: No – There are no "TODO: add proof" or similar markers that would require appending proof_generation.
