Current State:
- Code defines a struct "Lock<T>" which is a data structure needing invariants.
- There are placeholders "TODO: add requires and ensures" and "TODO: add specification" for function specs, and "TODO: add invariants" in the loop.
- No references to "View" or implementing a View function are present.

Dependencies:
- The "Lock<T>" struct will require invariants (its well_formed() function) and function specs (for take()).
- The function "take()" depends on the lock’s invariant being correctly established.

```

**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
This code contains a struct ("Lock<T>") needing invariants and explicit placeholders for function specifications ("TODO: add requires and ensures"). There are no "View" requirements or references. The Invariant-First Workflow is therefore appropriate.

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference
3. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes - input is a struct data structure (Lock<T>)
- proof_generation: Yes - "TODO: add invariants" is present
```
