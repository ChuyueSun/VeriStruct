# 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a struct `VecSet` with a “view” method that is incomplete.
- There are multiple "TODO" markers indicating missing specifications ("TODO: add requires and ensures"), a missing proof ("TODO: add proof"), and a missing loop invariant ("TODO: add invariant").
- Verification requires a proper View function, function specifications, invariants, and proofs.

Dependencies:
- `view` function needs to mathematically represent the `VecSet` contents as a `Set<u64>`.
- Each function (`new`, `insert`, `contains`) depends on having suitable `requires` and `ensures` clauses.
- The loop in `contains` requires a loop invariant to maintain correctness.
- Overall correctness depends on the structural invariant(s) of `VecSet` and the correctness of the `view` function.

# 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
- The code explicitly contains a “view” function for a struct (`VecSet`). This triggers the Full Sequence Workflow requirement.
- Because `VecSet` is a custom data structure, we include `inv_inference` to establish any necessary type invariants.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes (the code defines a struct `VecSet` needing type invariants)
- proof_generation: Yes (the code has “TODO: add proof” and “TODO: add invariant”)
```
