## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a "Node" struct representing a node in a binary search tree. It has a "TODO: add invariant" marker in the well_formed function and multiple "TODO: add requires and ensures" markers in insert, delete, and get operations.
- The BST property must be formally captured either via invariants or specifications.
- There is no explicit mention of implementing or refining a "View" trait despite the open spec functions that convert the BST to a Map.

Dependencies:
- The Node struct needs a well_formed invariant capturing BST properties.
- The insert, delete, and get methods depend on this invariant and require consistent requires/ensures clauses referencing well_formed.
- The "TODO: add invariants" indicates that proof obligations must be generated after the invariants are inferred.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
- The code has a class/struct data structure requiring invariants (“TODO: add invariant”).
- It also needs function specifications (“TODO: add requires and ensures”).
- There is no explicit requirement or keyword for a View implementation, so the Full Sequence Workflow is not used.

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference
3. proof_generation  ← Appended because "TODO: add invariant" is present

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – a Node struct is present and requires BST invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes – there is a “TODO: add invariant” marker.
```
