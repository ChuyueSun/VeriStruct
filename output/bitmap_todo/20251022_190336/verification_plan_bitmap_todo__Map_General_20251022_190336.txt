Current State:
- The BitMap struct has a placeholder "spec fn view(&self) -> Seq<bool>" with "TODO: implement view".
- Multiple functions (from, get_bit, set_bit, or) have "TODO: add requires and ensures".
- There is at least one "TODO: add proof" comment in set_bit (and also mentioned elsewhere).
- A data structure (BitMap) is defined, indicating potential need for invariants and a View function.
- No explicit invariant is currently implemented for BitMap.

Dependencies:
- The BitMap::view method and its correctness are interdependent with other functions (from, get_bit, set_bit, or) that must preserve the coherence between the code implementation and the spec.
- The set_bit proof usage depends on the correct specification of get_bit and set_bit macros/functions.

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
This code contains a struct (BitMap) requiring a View function, as evidenced by the "TODO: implement view" placeholder. Additionally, there are several "TODO: add requires and ensures" comments for BitMap methods, indicating the need for function specifications. Since BitMap is a data structure and explicitly includes a "view" function, the Full Sequence Workflow is appropriate. The inv_inference step is included because it is a struct data structure.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation  (triggered by "TODO: add proof")

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes - BitMap is a struct data structure, so type invariants may be necessary.
- proof_generation: Yes - The code contains "TODO: add proof" which triggers the final proof_generation step.
