## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a RingBuffer<T> struct which implements the "View" trait but lacks a proper View specification ("TODO: add specification").
- There are multiple function stubs (len, has_elements, is_full, etc.) missing requires/ensures clauses and associated proofs.
- A type invariant function (inv) is declared for RingBuffer but is incomplete ("TODO: add specification").
- The code also has multiple "TODO: add proof" markers indicating the need for proof blocks.

Dependencies:
- The RingBuffer<T> struct depends on a correct View abstraction for high-level verification of ring buffer properties.
- The ring buffer’s methods depend on consistent type invariants and complete function specifications.
- Proofs are needed for verifying the correctness of the ring buffer operations and ensuring they preserve invariants.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
- The code explicitly references a "View" trait implementation for RingBuffer<T>, indicating a required View abstraction.
- The ring buffer is a struct needing type invariants and specifications, and there are "TODO: add proof" placeholders.
- Given the presence of both a struct with invariants and View references, the Full Sequence Workflow is necessary.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes (the RingBuffer<T> is a struct needing a type_invariant).
- proof_generation: Yes (multiple “TODO: add proof” placeholders are present).
