    "instruction": "You are an expert in Verus (a Rust-based verification framework). Given the following Rust code that defines a data structure with private fields, create a closed spec function: `closed spec fn inv(&self) -> bool`. This function should capture all necessary invariants of the data structure. You are allowed to reference private fields directly (i.e., do not rely on \"view\" conversions unless absolutely necessary). Do not modify other parts of the code or add explanatory text\u2014just provide the final inv function definition.\n\n# Verus Common Knowledge\n\n## Important Notes\n- Don't delete existing non-buggy `#[trigger]`!\n- Don't change \"unwind\" to `(unwind) as bool`!\n- Return the complete modified Rust code in your response without explanations.\n\n## Spec Functions\n1. No Direct Method Calls:\n   In a spec function, you cannot directly call instance methods such as vector.is_full().\n2. Use the @ Operator:\n   To invoke methods on a variable within a spec, first convert it to its specification-level representation View with @.\n3. Always use vector.len() instead of vector@.len().\n4. Simplify Boolean Conjunctions:\n   When combining multiple conditions, avoid excessive &&&. Fewer (or well-structured) conjunctions make the spec code easier to read and debug.\n\n## Operators\nVerus extends Rust logical operators with low-precedence forms that are especially helpful in specification code:\n\nStandard Operators: &&, ||, ==>, <==>\nLow-Precedence Variants: &&& and |||\n\nThe meaning of &&& is the same as && (logical AND), and ||| is the same as || (logical OR), but with lower precedence. This allows you to write conditions in a \"bulleted list\" style that remains grouped in a logical manner:\n\n```\n&&& a ==> b\n&&& c\n&&& d <==> e && f\n```\n\nis equivalent to:\n\n```\n(a ==> b) && c && (d <==> (e && f))\n```\n\nNote:\n- Implication (==>) and equivalence (<==>) bind more tightly than &&& and |||.\n- Using &&&/||| can make long specifications clearer by grouping logical clauses neatly.\n\n\n# Verus Invariant Guidelines\n\n1. An invariant is a property that must hold for all valid instances of the data structure\n\n2. It should consider the relationships between fields and enforce structural properties\n\n3. For collections, consider:\n   - Size/capacity constraints\n   - Range bounds for indices\n   - Ordering properties\n   - Non-nullity of critical components\n\n4. Use `&&` for simple conjunctions and `&&&` for more complex ones\n\n5. For circular data structures, think about how the head/tail pointers relate to each other\n\n6. Include range checks when appropriate (e.g., indices must be less than length)\n\n\n# Verus Sequence Knowledge\n\nSeq<T> is a mathematical sequence type used in specifications:\n\n- Building: Seq::empty(), seq![x, y, z], Seq::singleton(x)\n- Length: s.len()\n- Indexing: s[i] (0-based)\n- Subrange: s.subrange(lo, hi) gives elements from index lo (inclusive) to hi (exclusive)\n- Concatenation: s1 + s2\n- Update: s.update(i, v) returns a new sequence with index i updated to value v\n- Contains: s.contains(v) checks if v is in the sequence\n- Push/pop: s.push(v), s.pop() (returns new sequence, doesn't modify original)\n- Equality: Use `=~=` for sequence equality, NOT `==` (e.g., `seq1 =~= seq2`, `self@.0 =~= old(self)@.0.subrange(1, (old(self)@.0.len()) as int)`)\n\nYou can use forall or exists for properties over sequences.\n\n## Subrange Usage\n\n1. Cast indices to `int`: `self.head as int`, not just `self.head`\n2. Use `.subrange(start, end)`, not `seq[start..end]`\n3. Wrap complex expressions: `(..).subrange((expression) as int, ...)`\n4. For full length: `(sequence.len()) as int`\n",
