## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a simple Account struct with a balance field (u64).
- The transfer function has a “TODO: add requires and ensures” marker, indicating missing function specifications.
- No invariants or View functions are requested in the code.

Dependencies:
- The transfer function depends on correct function specifications describing its behavior.
- The test function checks the result of calling transfer.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
- The code has a struct but does not request any type invariants.
- There is a direct “TODO: add requires and ensures,” and no mention of Views or invariants.
- Therefore, only function specifications are needed.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No (the code does not request or need type invariants)
- proof_generation: No (no “TODO: add proof” or “TODO: add invariants” found)
```
