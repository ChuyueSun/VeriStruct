## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a struct VecSet with a “view” function returning a Set<u64>.
- There are multiple “TODO” placeholders indicating missing requires/ensures and a needed proof.
- The presence of a “view” function explicitly requires modeling of a View abstraction.
- Because this is a struct, type invariants may also be relevant.

Dependencies:
- The VecSet struct’s mathematical abstraction depends on the View function.
- The insert and contains methods rely on the VecSet’s internal representation and require matching specifications.
- Proofs will be needed to verify the correctness of the “insert” logic and the loop invariant in “contains”.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
A “view” function is explicitly present in the code, triggering the need for view_inference and view_refinement before moving on to invariants and specifications. Additionally, VecSet is a struct so including inv_inference is appropriate. There are also “TODO: add proof” markers, which necessitates proof_generation as the final step.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes (VecSet is a struct requiring type invariants)
- proof_generation: Yes (found “TODO: add proof” and “TODO: add invariant”)
```
