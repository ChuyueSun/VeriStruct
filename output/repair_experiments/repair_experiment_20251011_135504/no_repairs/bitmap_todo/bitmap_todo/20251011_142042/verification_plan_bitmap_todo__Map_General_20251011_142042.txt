Current State:
- The BitMap struct is present, indicating a data-structure with an unimplemented spec fn view.
- There are several TODO markers requesting “TODO: implement view” and “TODO: add requires and ensures” as well as “TODO: add proof.”
- These indicate both View-related needs and specification/proof requirements.

Dependencies:
- The BitMap struct’s view function depends on converting its Vec<u64> into a Seq<bool>.
- Various functions (from, get_bit, set_bit, or) need specification clauses and associated proofs.

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
Because the code has an explicit spec fn view method and a TODO to implement it, View functionality is clearly required. Also, there is a struct data structure (BitMap), so we include inv_inference in the full sequence. Finally, multiple “TODO: add proof” markers exist, so we will append proof_generation at the end.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – the input is a struct (BitMap).
- proof_generation: Yes – “TODO: add proof” markers are present.
```
