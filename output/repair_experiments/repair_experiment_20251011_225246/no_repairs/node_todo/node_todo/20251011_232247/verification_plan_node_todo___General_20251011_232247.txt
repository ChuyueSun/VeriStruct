## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a BST node struct (Node<V>) and includes placeholder comments indicating missing invariants ("TODO: add invariant") and missing function specifications ("TODO: add requires and ensures").
- No explicit references to "View" or "TODO: add View" appear in the code, so a custom View implementation is not explicitly requested.
- The code asks for both type invariants (BST well-formed property) and specification clauses for insert/delete/get functions.

Dependencies:
- The Node<V> struct relies on well-formedness properties to maintain BST correctness.
- The insert, delete, and get functions depend on an invariant for Node<V> to prove postconditions and BST properties.
- Proof blocks will depend on the invariants once they are defined.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
- The code contains a data structure (struct Node<V>) requiring type invariants.
- There are "TODO: add requires and ensures" placeholders, indicating the need for specification clauses.
- There is no mention of "View" or a requirement to implement a View function, so the Full Sequence Workflow does not apply.

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference
3. proof_generation  (added because "TODO: add invariant" is present)

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – the Node<V> struct needs an invariant for the BST property.
- proof_generation: Yes – "TODO: add invariant" indicates additional proofs will be required.
```
