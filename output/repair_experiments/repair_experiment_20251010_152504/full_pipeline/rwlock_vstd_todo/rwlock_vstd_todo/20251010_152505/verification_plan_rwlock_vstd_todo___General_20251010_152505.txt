Current State:
- The code defines a struct (FixedParity) implementing the RwLockPredicate trait, with a "TODO: add specification" placeholder in its inv function.
- The RwLock itself is a data structure that has invariants enforced at the type level.
- No explicit “View” or “TODO: add View” requirements are present.
- The main gap is filling in the specification for FixedParity::inv.

Dependencies:
- RwLock depends on FixedParity::inv to validate stored values.
- The struct FixedParity’s correctness depends on properly specifying its invariant requirements.

**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
There is a class/struct data structure (FixedParity, along with the RwLock) that needs invariants. Additionally, there is a “TODO: add specification,” which is a specification-related placeholder indicating we also need function specifications. There is no explicit mention of any “View” requirements or “TODO: add View,” so the Invariant-First Workflow is appropriate.

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – FixedParity (and RwLock) are data structures requiring an invariant specification.
- proof_generation: No – There is no explicit “TODO: add proof” or “TODO: add invariants” statement.
```
