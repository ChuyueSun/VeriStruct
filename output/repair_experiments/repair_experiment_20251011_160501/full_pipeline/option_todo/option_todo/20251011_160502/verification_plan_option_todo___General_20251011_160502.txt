## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines an enum MyOption with several functions containing "TODO: add specification" or "TODO: add requires and ensures".
- There is no indication that MyOption needs or uses type invariants.
- There is no request for a View-based abstraction or "TODO: add View" marker.

Dependencies:
- The specification placeholders in the functions (is_Some, is_None, get_Some_0, Or, or, as_ref, unwrap) all depend on adding requires/ensures clauses.
- No invariants or proof obligations are referenced.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
There is a custom data structure (MyOption), but it does not require type invariants. Furthermore, there are explicit "TODO: add specification" markers and no "TODO: add View" or "TODO: add invariants" requests. Thus, only function specifications are needed.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No – the code does not request any type invariants.
- proof_generation: No – there are no “TODO: add proof” or “TODO: add invariants” markers.
```
