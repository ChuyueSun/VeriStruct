### 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code consists of standalone functions (binary_search, reverse, binary_search_no_spinoff) that need function specifications and loop invariants.
- There is no struct or class data structure requiring type invariants.
- The code contains "TODO: add specification" and "TODO: add invariants" placeholders, indicating missing function pre/post conditions and loop invariants.

Dependencies:
- Each function depends on the presence of correct requires/ensures clauses and appropriate loop invariants for verification.
- No data structure to maintain a type invariant or View function.

---

### 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
- The input does not define a custom data structure (no class/struct) and thus does not require type invariants.
- "TODO: add specification" placeholders indicate that only function specifications are needed.
- There is no mention of View or any need for a data structure View function.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference
2. proof_generation

(Proof generation is included because "TODO: add invariants" appears in the code.)

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No (there is no struct or class data structure)
- proof_generation: Yes ("TODO: add invariants" is present)
```
