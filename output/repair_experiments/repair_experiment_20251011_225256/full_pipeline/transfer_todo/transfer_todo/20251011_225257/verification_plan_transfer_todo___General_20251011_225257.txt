## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a simple struct (Account) and a transfer function with a "TODO: add requires and ensures" note.
- There is no mention of a desired type invariant on the Account struct, nor any reference to View functions.

Dependencies:
- The only specification-related requirement is on the transfer function.
- No indications of needing a type invariant for Account or a View implementation.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
The code only has a request to add function specifications ("TODO: add requires and ensures"). There is no mention of invariants or a View function requirement. Because a type invariant is not explicitly requested, and there is no View-related task, the specification-only workflow is appropriate.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No – there is a struct but no requested or indicated invariants.
- proof_generation: No – there is no "TODO: add proof" or "TODO: add invariants".
```
