Current State:
- The code defines a BitMap struct (i.e., a data structure) and already includes a spec fn view.
- No explicit TODO markers for adding invariants or specifications are present.
- The code explicitly mentions “view” in its type, indicating a verified abstraction of BitMap.

Dependencies:
- The BitMap’s behavior is captured by its view() function, which abstracts the bits field into a Seq<bool>.
- Functions like get_bit, set_bit, and or rely on the view to connect their ensures clauses to the underlying bit-array representations.

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
The BitMap struct explicitly defines a “view()” function, meeting the criterion for “Full Sequence Workflow” when a View is present in the type definitions. Because BitMap is a struct, we include the inv_inference step to cover possible struct invariants.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – the input is a struct data structure (BitMap).
- proof_generation: No – there are no “TODO: add proof” or “TODO: add invariants” markers.
```
