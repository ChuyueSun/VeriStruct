### 1. Analysis Summary
```markdown
Current State:
- The code defines a BST node as a generic struct that contains key-value pairs and child pointers; however, critical specification annotations are missing.
- There are several "TODO: add requires and ensures" placeholders in methods (insert, delete_from_optional, delete_rightmost, get_from_optional, get) and a "TODO: add invariant" placeholder in the well_formed method.
- The well-formedness invariant for the BST property is not provided, which is central to the correctness of many operations.

Dependencies:
- The Node struct’s operations (insert, delete, get) depend on a correct invariant (well_formed) and on the map representation provided by as_map and optional_as_map.
- The missing pre-/post-conditions in the functions must be specified to ensure the BST invariants hold before and after modifications.
```

### 2. Verification Plan
```markdown
**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
The input code defines a class/struct (Node<V>) that requires type invariants for maintaining BST properties. In addition, there are placeholders ("TODO: add requires and ensures" and "TODO: add invariant") that indicate missing specification components. These characteristics make the Invariant-First Workflow the optimal choice.

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference – Generate the appropriate invariant function for the Node struct (especially to define a proper well_formed invariant for the BST property).
2. spec_inference – Infer and add the necessary requires and ensures clauses for the functions (insert_into_optional, insert, delete_from_optional, delete_rightmost, get_from_optional, and get).

3. proof_generation – Append this final step due to the existence of placeholders like "TODO: add invariant" that indicate the need for additional proof obligations.

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – The input qualifies as a class/struct data structure (Node<V>) that requires type invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes – The presence of "TODO: add invariant" and "TODO: add requires and ensures" markers necessitates the final proof generation step.
