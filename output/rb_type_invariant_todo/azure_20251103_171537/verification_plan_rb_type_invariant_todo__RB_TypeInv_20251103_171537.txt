Current State:
- The RingBuffer<T> struct explicitly implements the "View" trait but lacks a corresponding view specification.
- There are placeholder TODOs for type invariants, function specifications (requires/ensures), and proofs.
- The struct has a #[verifier::type_invariant] annotation indicating a need for invariants.

Dependencies:
- The RingBuffer<T> type_invariant depends on a correct View function for the data structure.
- Each RingBuffer<T> method’s proof depends on corresponding function specifications and invariants.

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
The code contains an explicit "impl View" block for the RingBuffer<T> struct, which triggers the requirement for view_inference and view_refinement steps. Since RingBuffer<T> is a struct with a type_invariant, the inv_inference step is also applicable. Finally, there are several "TODO: add proof" markers, which necessitate proof_generation at the end.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – RingBuffer<T> is a struct with #[verifier::type_invariant].
- proof_generation: Yes – "TODO: add proof" exists in the code.
