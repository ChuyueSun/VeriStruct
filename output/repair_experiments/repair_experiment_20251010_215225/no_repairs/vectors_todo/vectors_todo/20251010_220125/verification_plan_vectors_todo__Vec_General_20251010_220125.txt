## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code contains three functions (binary_search, reverse, binary_search_no_spinoff) with “TODO: add specification” comments indicating missing function specifications.
- There are also “TODO: add invariants” comments for loop invariants, but these refer to loops in functions rather than type invariants on a custom data structure.
- No user-defined struct or class requires a type invariant; all functions operate on built-in Vec.

Dependencies:
- The missing function specifications (requires/ensures) are needed for binary_search, reverse, and binary_search_no_spinoff.
- Loop invariants in these functions depend on the same verification context that the specifications will establish.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
- The code does not define any new struct/class type requiring a type invariant, so inv_inference is not applicable.
- There is no mention of “View” or a need for view_inference/view_refinement; thus, the Full Sequence Workflow is unnecessary.
- The primary placeholders are “TODO: add specification,” so Specification-Only Workflow is appropriate.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference
2. proof_generation  (appended because “TODO: add invariants” is present)

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No – the code does not contain a custom struct or class requiring type invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes – “TODO: add invariants” in the loops implies a need for additional proof details.
