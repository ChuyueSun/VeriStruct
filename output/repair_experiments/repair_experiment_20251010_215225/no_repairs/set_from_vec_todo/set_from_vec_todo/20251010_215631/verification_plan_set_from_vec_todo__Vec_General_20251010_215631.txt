## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a struct (VecSet) with a “view” function explicitly mentioned but not yet implemented.
- Each function in VecSet has placeholders for “requires” and “ensures,” and there is a “TODO: add proof” marker.
- The code is incomplete and needs both invariant coverage (since VecSet is a struct) and specification details.
- A “View” function is present and incomplete.

Dependencies:
- The VecSet struct’s abstract View is intended to return a Set<u64>.
- The VecSet methods (new, insert, contains) require specifications to align with their intended behavior.
- The “TODO: add proof” step indicates function correctness or loop invariants must be formally proven.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
This code includes a struct (VecSet) that requires type invariants and has an explicitly declared “view” function (“pub closed spec fn view”). Thus, a View-based verification approach applies. Additionally, the presence of “TODO: add requires/ensures” and “TODO: add proof” signifies that all four steps of the Full Sequence Workflow are necessary.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference  (because VecSet is a struct needing invariants)
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation  (triggered by “TODO: add proof”)

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – VecSet is a struct data structure.
- proof_generation: Yes – “TODO: add proof” is present.
```
