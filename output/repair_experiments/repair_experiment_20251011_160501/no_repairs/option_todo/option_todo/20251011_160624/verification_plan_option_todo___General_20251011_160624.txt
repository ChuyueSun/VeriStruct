Current State:
- Multiple functions (is_Some, is_None, get_Some_0, Or, or, is_some, is_none, as_ref, unwrap) have "TODO: add specification" or "TODO: add requires and ensures"
- No mention of "View" or "TODO: add View"
- No mention of invariants needed for the enum MyOption
- No "TODO: add proof" or "TODO: add invariants"

Dependencies:
- The only dependencies are between MyOption operations and their respective specifications (e.g., unwrap depends on the logic of is_some)

```

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
Since this is an enum rather than a class/struct, we do not infer type invariants. We only have function-specification placeholders (e.g., "TODO: add requires and ensures"), and no mention of any View or type invariants. Therefore, the Specification-Only Workflow applies.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No – we do not have a struct/class necessitating invariants.
- proof_generation: No – there are no "TODO: add proof" or "TODO: add invariants" markers.
```
