## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines three functions (binary_search, reverse, binary_search_no_spinoff) operating on built-in Vec<u64> without any custom data structure.
- Each function contains "TODO: add specification" and loop-level "TODO: add invariants."
- No "View" features or custom type invariants are required.

Identified Missing Components:
- Function requires/ensures specifications are needed for verification.
- Loop invariants are required for each while/for loop to validate correctness.

Critical Verification Challenges:
- Ensuring loop conditions and array bounds are properly specified in loop invariants.
- Adding the correct pre/post conditions (requires/ensures) for each function.

Dependencies:
- The functions rely on Vec<u64> from the vstd library, but there is no new struct/class requiring a type-level invariant.
- The correctness of the loops depends on newly added loop invariants and function specifications.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
- The code does not define any custom data structure (class/struct) that needs type invariants.
- There are explicit "TODO: add specification" placeholders, indicating required function specifications.
- No "View" implementation is mentioned, thus no need for a View-based workflow.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference
2. proof_generation

(The proof_generation step is appended because the code contains "TODO: add invariants," indicating additional proofs will be needed.)

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No (it applies to data structures with type invariants; none are present here)
- proof_generation: Yes (due to the “TODO: add invariants” markings)
```
