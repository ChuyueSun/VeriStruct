## 1) Analysis Summary

Current State:
- A struct VecSet with an incomplete "view" function is present, indicating a required "View" implementation.
- Several functions (new, insert, contains) have “TODO: add requires and ensures” placeholders.
- There is also “TODO: add proof” and “TODO: add invariant” in the code, signaling further verification steps needed.

Dependencies:
- The VecSet struct’s view function depends on properly abstracting Vec<u64> as a mathematical Set<u64>.
- Correct specifications in new, insert, and contains will rely on any necessary invariants for VecSet.
- The proofs in insert (and any future ones) will depend on established invariants and specifications.

## 2) Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
- The code explicitly defines a "View" function (pub closed spec fn view), which triggers the Full Sequence Workflow requirement.
- VecSet is a struct requiring invariants, and its methods have “TODO: add requires and ensures” placeholders, consistent with needing full coverage of view, invariants, and specifications.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference   (since VecSet is a struct)
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation (due to “TODO: add proof” and “TODO: add invariant”)

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes — VecSet is a struct needing type invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes — “TODO: add proof” and “TODO: add invariant” are present.
