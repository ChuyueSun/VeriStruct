Current State:
- The BitMap struct is missing its View function implementation ("TODO: implement view").
- Several methods (from, get_bit, set_bit, or) lack requires/ensures clauses.
- There is a “TODO: add proof” inside set_bit and a “TODO: add loop invariant” in the or function.
- These indicate the need for a full verification strategy: View inference, specification inference, and final proof steps.

Dependencies:
- The view function will abstract the internal Vec<u64> into a Seq<bool>.
- The set_bit, get_bit, and or methods depend on accurate specification clauses to verify their correctness against the intended View.
- Proofs (especially for set_bit and the loop in or) depend on specifying preconditions, postconditions, and either type or loop invariants for this BitMap data structure.

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
The code defines a struct BitMap, requests a “TODO: implement view” method, and thus explicitly requires a View function. It also includes “TODO: add requires/ensures” placeholders for methods, confirming the need for specification inference, plus a “TODO: add proof” that necessitates final proof generation. Because a struct is present, we will include inv_inference as part of the workflow.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – BitMap is a struct needing invariants (e.g., vector length or valid bit indices).
- proof_generation: Yes – The code has “TODO: add proof” and a “TODO: add loop invariant” that requires a proof step.
