Current State:
- A "BitMap" struct is present, indicating a data structure.
- The "view" function is declared but not implemented ("TODO: implement view").
- Multiple methods (“from”, “get_bit”, “set_bit”, “or”) have “TODO: add requires and ensures”.
- There are “TODO: add proof” markers in “set_bit” and “or” methods.
- Overall, the code indicates the need for a finalized “View” plus specifications, invariants, and proofs.

Dependencies:
- The “view” function depends on correctly mapping each u64 chunk to a sequence of bits, preserving alignment and ordering.
- Invariants likely depend on keeping the length of “bits” consistent with the intended capacity or other constraints.
- Each function’s specification (requires, ensures) must be consistent with the struct invariants and the “view” function’s abstraction.
- Proofs (e.g., “set_bit64_proof” or loop invariants for “or”) depend on these specifications.

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
A “View” function is explicitly required (“TODO: implement view”).
There is also a struct (“BitMap”) needing type invariants and function specifications.
Hence, we must include both view steps and invariant inference, followed by specification inference.
Finally, we have “TODO: add proof” markers, so proof_generation is appended.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes, because “BitMap” is a struct requiring invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes, due to “TODO: add proof” markers in the code.
