Current State:
- The code defines a struct BitMap with an unfinished spec fn view that explicitly mentions "TODO: implement view."
- Several functions in BitMap also have "TODO: add requires and ensures."
- There are “TODO: add proof” markers indicating proof obligations.
- This is a data-structure (class/struct) which requires a full verification approach including a View function.

Dependencies:
- The BitMap struct’s correctness depends on its view function accurately reflecting the boolean sequence of bits.
- Functions like from, get_bit, set_bit, and or need proper specifications (requires/ensures).
- Proofs depend on the final form of the view function and any invariants established.

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
The code explicitly contains a "View" function (spec fn view) marked with a "TODO: implement view," so it requires the Full Sequence Workflow. The structure BitMap is clearly a data structure, so we include the inv_inference step before finalizing specifications. Additionally, "TODO: add proof" is present, triggering proof_generation at the end.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes - because BitMap is a struct and may need invariants for its internal u64 array.
- proof_generation: Yes - there are "TODO: add proof" markers requiring proof obligations.
