## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a struct (FixedParity) implementing the RwLockPredicate trait.
- There is a "TODO: add specification" placeholder in its 'inv' function.
- No "TODO: add invariants" or "TODO: add proof" markers are present.
- No mention of “View” functions or explicit view-related requirements is found.

Identified Missing Components:
- Type invariants are needed for the struct data (FixedParity is a struct).
- The function specification for the ‘inv’ method must be filled in (the "TODO: add specification" placeholder).

Critical Verification Challenges:
- Ensuring the correctness of the struct’s invariants while also providing the required “inv” function specification.

Dependencies:
- FixedParity struct relies on the RwLockPredicate trait, which requires a valid predicate specification.
- The RwLock implementation depends on the correctness of that predicate for proof obligations.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow
(inv_inference → spec_inference)

**Justification:**
Since the code involves a struct (FixedParity) that must satisfy type invariants and has a “TODO: add specification” placeholder for its ‘inv’ method (indicating a need for function specifications), the Invariant-First Workflow is appropriate. No view-related or proof-related TODO markers were found, so we do not use the Full Sequence Workflow or append a proof_generation step.

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – FixedParity is a struct and requires type invariants.
- proof_generation: No – There are no “TODO: add proof” or “TODO: add invariants” markers present.
