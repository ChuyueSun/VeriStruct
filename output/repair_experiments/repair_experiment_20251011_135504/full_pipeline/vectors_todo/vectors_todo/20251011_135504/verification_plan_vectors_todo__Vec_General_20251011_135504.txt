## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines free functions (binary_search, reverse, binary_search_no_spinoff, etc.) and contains placeholders "TODO: add specification" and "TODO: add invariants."
- There are no class/struct data structures, so type invariants are not applicable here.
- There is no "View" keyword or mention of implementing a View function.

Dependencies:
- The key dependencies involve adding appropriate requires/ensures for each function’s specification.
- The loop invariants (marked as "TODO: add invariants") also require proof support, indicating the need for a proof step.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
The code does not contain any class/struct data structures, so no type invariants are needed. Also, there is no mention of "View" or a View function requirement, making a View-based approach unnecessary. The placeholders explicitly request function specifications, so the Specification-Only Workflow is the best fit. Because "TODO: add invariants" appears (loop invariants, not type invariants), we will add a proof_generation step at the end.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference
2. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No (there is no struct or class requiring type invariants)
- proof_generation: Yes (the code contains "TODO: add invariants")
```
