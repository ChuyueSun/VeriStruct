Current State:
- The struct "FixedParity" implements RwLockPredicate<u64> but leaves its inv() function body with a "TODO: add specification."
- This indicates a specification placeholder is present.
- There is no mention of needing or refining a View function.
- A data-structure (struct FixedParity) is present, so we may need invariants as well.

Dependencies:
- The code depends on the RwLock trait’s invariant enforcement, and the “inv” function in FixedParity must uphold that invariant for stored values.
- The specification for inv() is needed before the lock can be fully verified.

**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
Because there is a struct (FixedParity) that needs type invariants and we have a “TODO: add specification” placeholder, we perform both invariant and specification inference in tandem. There is no explicit requirement for a View function, so a full sequence workflow is not necessary.

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – the code defines a struct (FixedParity) needing invariant generation.
- proof_generation: No – no “TODO: add proof” or “TODO: add invariants” markers are present.
```
