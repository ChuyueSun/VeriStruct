Current State:
- The code defines a struct BitMap that stores bits in a Vec<u64>, and it includes a spec fn view() that is not yet implemented.
- There are multiple "TODO" items:
  - "TODO: implement view" indicates a need for a View function.
  - "TODO: add requires and ensures" indicates missing specifications for functions like from, get_bit, set_bit, and or.
  - "TODO: add proof" is present in set_bit and or, indicating final proofs are needed.
- Verification must ensure BitMap's field usage is consistent with a correct mathematical abstraction via a View, plus associated invariants and specifications.

Dependencies:
- The BitMap.view() function depends on translating fields in bits: Vec<u64> into a Seq<bool>.
- The from, get_bit, set_bit, and or methods depend on both the type invariants (if any) and the correctness of the view’s abstraction for bit manipulation.
- The proofs for set_bit and or rely on the correctness of the specifications and invariants.

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
- The code explicitly contains a BitMap struct (a data structure) and a spec fn view() that must be completed.
- "TODO: implement view" confirms we must include View inferences.
- We also have function specifications to add, so the full sequence matches all criteria for a struct needing a View plus specs.
- Since there is a "TODO: add proof," we append proof_generation at the end.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – BitMap is a struct data structure, so it may need invariants on the bits vector.
- proof_generation: Yes – "TODO: add proof" is present in the code.
