Current State:
- The code defines a data structure (BitMap) and explicitly includes a spec fn view(&self) -> Seq<bool> that is not yet implemented.
- Multiple “TODO: add requires and ensures” markers indicate missing function specifications.
- There are “TODO: add proof” markers indicating missing proof obligations.
- Hence, the code requires full verification with View and invariants, plus additional proofs.

Dependencies:
- The BitMap::view function is central to deriving correct function specifications and type invariants.
- The set_bit and or methods depend on proofs regarding their bitwise correctness and preservation of other bits.
- The from and get_bit routines also need specifications that likely refer to the BitMap’s view.

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
This code has an explicit “view(&self) -> Seq<bool>” function to be implemented and references “TODO: implement view”. Since it is a struct data structure and includes View-related requirements, the Full Sequence Workflow is needed to generate and refine the view, infer potential invariants, and infer function specifications. Also, there are “TODO: add proof” markers, so proof_generation is appended.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes - input is a struct that may need type invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes - “TODO: add proof” markers are present.
```
