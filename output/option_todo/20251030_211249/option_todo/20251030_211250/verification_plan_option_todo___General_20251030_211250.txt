## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines an enum MyOption with several functions containing "TODO: add specification" and "TODO: add requires and ensures" placeholders.
- There are no mentions of "View" or view-related requirements.
- There are no indications that a type invariant is needed (no "TODO: add invariants" or similar).
- No "TODO: add proof" markers are present.

Dependencies:
- All missing specifications relate to function requires/ensures clauses.
- No invariants or view relationships are referenced.

---

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
- The code does not require View implementation.
- No explicit or implied invariants are requested for the enum-based MyOption.
- Multiple placeholders explicitly ask for function specifications ("TODO: add specification" / "TODO: add requires and ensures").

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No (the enum does not require a type invariant, and no invariant placeholders exist)
- proof_generation: No (no "TODO: add proof" markers are present)
