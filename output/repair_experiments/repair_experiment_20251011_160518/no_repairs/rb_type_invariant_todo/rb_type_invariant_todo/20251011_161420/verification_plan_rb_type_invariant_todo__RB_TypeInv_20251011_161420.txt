## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a struct “RingBuffer<T>” that clearly requires a “View” implementation (see the “impl<T: Copy> View for RingBuffer<T>” block).
- “TODO” markers exist in the code for adding specification items (requires/ensures) and invariants, as well as proofs.
- No proofs are fully implemented; multiple “TODO: add proof” markers appear.
- A “type_invariant” is declared for RingBuffer, indicating it needs an invariant specification.

Dependencies:
- The RingBuffer struct depends on a valid View function to capture its abstract representation.
- The correctness of enqueue/dequeue operations depends on the type invariant (inv) and function specifications.
- Proofs will depend on the newly added invariants and function specifications.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
The code explicitly implements “impl<T: Copy> View for RingBuffer<T>” and includes a “TODO: add specification” within that View block. This direct need for a View function triggers the Full Sequence Workflow. Since RingBuffer is a struct, it will also require invariants, and it contains multiple specification placeholders. Finally, multiple “TODO: add proof” markers indicate we will append proof_generation at the end.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – RingBuffer is a struct with a type invariant needed.
- proof_generation: Yes – The code has “TODO: add proof” markers.
