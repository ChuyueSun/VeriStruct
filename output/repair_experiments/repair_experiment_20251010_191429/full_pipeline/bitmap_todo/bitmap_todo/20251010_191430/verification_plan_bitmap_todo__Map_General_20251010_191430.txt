## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- A "view" function is explicitly required by the code ("TODO: implement view"). This indicates a need for a View-based abstraction of the BitMap structure.
- Multiple "TODO: add requires and ensures" placeholders exist, so specifications are needed for several functions.
- The code is a struct-based data structure (BitMap). Invariants are likely desired for correctness.
- There are explicit "TODO: add proof" comments (e.g., in set_bit), indicating final proof obligations are also needed.

Identified Missing Components:
- A complete implementation of the spec fn view(&self) -> Seq<bool>.
- Type invariants or consistency requirements for BitMap (inv_inference).
- Requires/ensures clauses for from, get_bit, set_bit, and or functions.
- Final proof details (proof blocks) for set_bit (and possibly others).

Critical Verification Challenges:
- Translating the internal u64-based storage into a sequence of boolean bits in the view function.
- Ensuring bit-setting/getting remains consistent with the view abstraction and any invariants.
- Strengthening or creating new invariants if needed to prove correctness.
- Providing final proofs to discharge verification conditions once all specs/invariants/views are in place.

Dependencies:
- The BitMap struct’s view function underlies correctness of get_bit, set_bit, and or operations.
- The from, get_bit, set_bit, and or functions depend on well-formed specifications and possibly invariants.
- Proving correctness of set_bit and bitwise OR depends on a proper view plus any invariants about length, valid indices, etc.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
- The code explicitly requires a "View" implementation with "TODO: implement view," so the Full Sequence Workflow is mandatory.
- We also have a struct data structure (BitMap), indicating the optional inv_inference step applies.
- Multiple TODOs for specifications and final proofs confirm that spec_inference and a proof_generation step are necessary.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation  (added due to "TODO: add proof")

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes (BitMap is a struct; type invariants and correctness properties are to be inferred)
- proof_generation: Yes (set_bit and others have "TODO: add proof" markers)
```
