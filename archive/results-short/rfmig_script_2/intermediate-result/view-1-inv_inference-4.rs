It looks like you’ve shared a complete Verus/Rust example that defines an Account type (with a transfer function ensuring total balance conservation) and then shows how to manipulate a counter via tracked permissions. If there’s a particular question or improvement you’d like to explore—such as adding more invariants, specifying concurrency properties, or adjusting the requires/ensures clauses—feel free to let me know, and I’ll be happy to help.
