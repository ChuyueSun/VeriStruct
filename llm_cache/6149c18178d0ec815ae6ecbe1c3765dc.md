# Prompt

## System
You are a helpful AI assistant specialized in Verus formal verification.

## Instruction
You are an expert in Verus (verifier for rust). You have two main tasks:

TASK 1: Add `requires` and `ensures` to public functions
   - Analyze the semantics of functions and add appropriate preconditions and postconditions
   - Change function signatures to `-> (retname: rettype)` format when adding return value specifications
   - Use precise, mathematical specifications that capture the function's behavior

TASK 2: Fill in `spec fn` implementations where you see "TODO: add specification"
   - Implement the specification function based on the context and function name

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
   - DO NOT just copy the implementation code in specifications
   - You may use `self.view().XXX` or `self@XXX` in `ensures` clauses
   - If `self.view()` is a tuple, you can use `self@.i` to access the i-th element (zero-indexed)
   - DO NOT use `old` without consideration: "only a variable binding is allowed as the argument to old"
   - DO NOT use `match` or `let` in the `ensures` clause or `requires` clause, but you can use `match` within `spec fn` bodies
   - DO NOT modify anything in `fn main()`
   - DO NOT add `self.inv()` to pre/post-conditions if `#[verifier::type_invariant]` is used
   - Spec functions (like View) cannot have their own requires/ensures clauses
   
RETURN FORMAT:
   - Return the ENTIRE file with your changes integrated into the original code, not just the parts you modified

# Verus Common Knowledge

## Important Notes
- Don't delete existing non-buggy `#[trigger]`!
- Don't change "unwind" to `(unwind) as bool`!
- Return the complete modified Rust code in your response without explanations.

## Spec Functions
1. No Direct Method Calls:
   In a spec function, you cannot directly call instance methods such as vector.is_full().
2. Use the @ Operator:
   To invoke methods on a variable within a spec, first convert it to its specification-level representation View with @.
3. Always use vector.len() instead of vector@.len().
4. Simplify Boolean Conjunctions:
   When combining multiple conditions, avoid excessive &&&. Fewer (or well-structured) conjunctions make the spec code easier to read and debug.

## Operators
Verus extends Rust logical operators with low-precedence forms that are especially helpful in specification code:

Standard Operators: &&, ||, ==>, <==>
Low-Precedence Variants: &&& and |||

The meaning of &&& is the same as && (logical AND), and ||| is the same as || (logical OR), but with lower precedence. This allows you to write conditions in a "bulleted list" style that remains grouped in a logical manner:

```
&&& a ==> b
&&& c
&&& d <==> e && f
```

is equivalent to:

```
(a ==> b) && c && (d <==> (e && f))
```

Note:
- Implication (==>) and equivalence (<==>) bind more tightly than &&& and |||.
- Using &&&/||| can make long specifications clearer by grouping logical clauses neatly.


# Verus Requires and Ensures Guidelines

## Formatting for `requires` and `ensures`

```rust
fn func(arg) -> rettype
    requires
        REQUIREMENT1,
        REQUIREMENT2,
        ...
    ensures
        ENSUREMENT1,
        ENSUREMENT2,
        if COND {
            &&& ENSUREMENT3_1
            &&& ENSUREMENT3_2
        } else {
            &&& ENSUREMENT4_1
            &&& ENSUREMENT4_2
        }
        ...
```

- In requires, use `old(self)` to refer to the pre-state of an &mut variable.
- When using the return value in an `ensures` clause, assign it a name if not already provided (change the return type of the function), e.g.:

```rust
fn func(arg) -> (retname: rettype)
```

- When using if-else blocks in ensures clauses, always use `&&&` instead of `&&` to connect multiple conditions, as shown in the example above.



# InvariantPredicate Guidelines

// TODO:
//  * utility for conveniently creating unique namespaces

// An invariant storing objects of type V needs to be able to have some kind of configurable
// predicate `V -> bool`. However, doing this naively with a fully configurable
// predicate function would result in V being reject_recursive_types,
// which is too limiting and prevents important use cases with recursive types.

//
// Instead, we allow the user to specify a predicate which is fixed *at the type level*
// which we do through this trait, InvariantPredicate. However, the predicate still
// needs to be "dynamically configurable" upon the call to the invariant constructor.
// To support this, we add another type parameter K, a constant is fixed for a given
// Invariant object.
//
// So each Invariant object has 3 type parameters:
//  * K - A "constant" which is specified at constructor time
//  * V - Type of the stored 'tracked' object
//  * Pred: InvariantPredicate - provides the predicate (K, V) -> bool
//
// With this setup, we can now declare both K and V without reject_recursive_types.
// To be sure, note that the following, based on our trait formalism,
// is well-formed CIC (Coq), without any type polarity issues:
//
// ```
//    Inductive InvariantPredicate K V :=
//        | inv_pred : (K -> V -> bool) -> InvariantPredicate K V.
//
//    Inductive Inv (K V: Type) (x: InvariantPredicate K V) :=
//      | inv : K -> Inv K V x.
//
//    Definition some_predicate (V: Type) : InvariantPredicate nat V :=
//      inv_pred nat V (fun k v => false). (* an arbitrary predicate *)
//
//    (* example recursive type *)
//    Inductive T :=
//      | A : (Inv nat T (some_predicate T)) -> T.
// ```
//
// Note that the user can always just set K to be `V -> bool` in order to make the
// Invariant's predicate maximally configurable without having to restrict it at the
// type level. By doing so, the user opts in to the negative usage of V in exchange
// for the flexibility.

verus! {

/// Trait used to specify an _invariant predicate_ for
/// [`LocalInvariant`] and [`AtomicInvariant`].
pub trait InvariantPredicate<K, V> {
    spec fn inv(k: K, v: V) -> bool;
}

} // verus!
// LocalInvariant is NEVER `Sync`.
//
// Furthermore, for either type:
//
//  * If an Invariant<T> is Sync, then T must be Send
//      * We could put the T in an Invariant, sync the invariant to another thread,
//        and then extract the T, having effectively send it to the other thread.
//  * If Invariant<T> is Send, then T must be Send
//      * We could put the T in an Invariant, send the invariant to another thread,
//        and then take the T out.
//
// So the Sync/Send-ness of the Invariant depends on the Send-ness of T;
// however, the Sync-ness of T is unimportant (the invariant doesn't give you an extra
// ability to share a reference to a T across threads).
//
// In conclusion, we should have:
//
//    T                   AtomicInvariant<T>  LocalInvariant<T>
//
//    {}          ==>     {}                  {}
//    Send        ==>     Send+Sync           Send
//    Sync        ==>     {}                  {}
//    Sync+Send   ==>     Send+Sync           Send

// In the "Logical Paradoxes" section of the Iris 4.1 Reference
// (`https://plv.mpi-sws.org/iris/appendix-4.1.pdf`), they show that
// opening invariants carries the risk of unsoundness.
//
// The paradox is similar to "Landin's knot", a short program that implements
// an infinite loop by combining two features: higher-order closures
// and mutable state:
//
//    let r := new_ref();
//    r := () -> {
//        let f = !r;
//        f();
//    };
//    let f = !r;
//    f();
//
// Invariants effectively serve as "mutable state"
// Therefore, in order to implement certain higher-order features
// like "proof closures" or "dyn", we need to make sure we have an
// answer to this paradox.
//
// One solution to
// this, described in the paper "Later Credits: Resourceful Reasoning
// for the Later Modality" by Spies et al. (available at
// `https://plv.mpi-sws.org/later-credits/paper-later-credits.pdf`) is
// to use "later credits". That is, require the expenditure of a later
// credit, only obtainable in exec mode, when opening an invariant. So

///
/// ### Usage
///
/// The form of the macro looks like,
///
/// ```rust
/// open_atomic_invariant($inv => $id => {
///     // Inner scope
/// });
/// ```
///
/// This operation is very similar to [`open_local_invariant!`], so we refer to its
/// documentation for the basics. There is only one difference, besides
/// the fact that `$inv` should be an [`&AtomicInvariant`](AtomicInvariant)
/// rather than a [`&LocalInvariant`](LocalInvariant).
/// The difference is that `open_atomic_invariant!` has an additional _atomicity constraint_:
///
///  * **Atomicity constraint**: The code body of an `open_atomic_invariant!` block
///    cannot contain any `exec`-mode code with the exception of a _single_ atomic operation.
///
/// (Of course, the code block can still contain an arbitrary amount of ghost code.)
///
/// The atomicity constraint is needed because an `AtomicInvariant` must be thread-safe;
/// that is, it can be shared across threads. In order for the ghost state to be shared
/// safely, it must be restored after each atomic operation.
///
/// The atomic operations may be found in the [`PAtomic`](crate::atomic) library.
/// The user can also mark their own functions as "atomic operations" using
/// `#[verifier::atomic)]`; however, this is not useful for very much other than defining
/// wrappers around the existing atomic operations from [`PAtomic`](crate::atomic).
/// Note that reading and writing through a [`PCell`](crate::cell::PCell)
/// or a [`PPtr`](crate::simple_pptr::PPtr) are _not_ atomic operations.
///
/// **Note:** Rather than using `open_atomic_invariant!` directly, we generally recommend
/// using the [`atomic_ghost` APIs](crate::atomic_ghost).
///
/// It's not legal to use `open_atomic_invariant!` in proof mode. In proof mode, you need
/// to use `open_atomic_invariant_in_proof!` instead. This takes one extra parameter,
/// an open-invariant credit, which you can get by calling
/// `create_open_invariant_credit()` before you enter proof mode.

/// ### Example

///
/// ### Avoiding Reentrancy
///
/// Verus adds additional checks to ensure that an invariant is never opened
/// more than once at the same time. For example, suppose that you attempt to nest
/// the use of `open_invariant`, supplying the same argument `inv` to each:
///
/// ```rust
/// open_local_invariant(inv => id1 => {
///     open_local_invariant(inv => id2 => {
///     });
/// });
/// ```
///
/// In this situation, Verus would produce an error:
///
/// ```
/// error: possible invariant collision
///   |
///   |   open_local_invariant!(&inv => id1 => {
///   |                           ^ this invariant
///   |       open_local_invariant!(&inv => id2 => {
///   |                               ^ might be the same as this invariant
///   ...
///   |       }
///   |   }
/// ```
///
/// When generating these conditions, Verus compares invariants via their
/// [`namespace()`](LocalInvariant::namespace) values.
/// An invariant's namespace (represented simply as an integer)
/// is specified upon the call to [`LocalInvariant::new`].
/// If you have the need to open multiple invariants at once, make sure to given
/// them different namespaces.
///
/// So that Verus can ensure that there are no nested invariant accesses across function
/// boundaries, every `proof` and `exec` function has, as part of its specification,
/// the set of invariant namespaces that it might open.
///
/// The invariant set of a function can be specified via the [`opens_invariants` clause](https://verus-lang.github.io/verus/guide/reference-opens-invariants.html).
/// The default for an `exec`-mode function is to open any, while the default
/// for a `proof`-mode function is to open none.
///
/// It's not legal to use `open_local_invariant!` in proof mode. In proof mode, you need
/// to use `open_local_invariant_in_proof!` instead. This takes one extra parameter,
/// an open-invariant credit, which you can get by calling
/// `create_open_invariant_credit()` before you enter proof mode.

# Verus Match Syntax Guidelines

## Using `matches!` Macro

In Verus, the `matches!` macro must use Rust's standard macro syntax:

```rust
// CORRECT
pub open spec fn is_Some<A>(opt: MyOption<A>) -> bool {
    matches!(opt, MyOption::Some(_))
}

// INCORRECT - don't use this syntax
pub open spec fn is_Some<A>(opt: MyOption<A>) -> bool {
    matches opt {
        MyOption::Some(_) => true,
        MyOption::None => false,
    }
}
```

## Match with `arbitrary()` in Spec Functions

When writing spec functions that match on patterns with impossible/unreachable branches, use `arbitrary()` instead of `unreachable!()`:

```rust
// CORRECT
pub open spec fn get_Some_0<A>(opt: MyOption<A>) -> A
    recommends is_Some(opt)
{
    match opt {
        MyOption::Some(a) => a,
        MyOption::None => arbitrary(), // For unreachable branches in spec functions
    }
}

// INCORRECT
pub open spec fn get_Some_0<A>(opt: MyOption<A>) -> A
    recommends is_Some(opt)
{
    match opt {
        MyOption::Some(a) => a,
        MyOption::None => unreachable!(), // Don't use this in spec functions
    }
}
```

## Match in Executable Functions

For unreachable branches in executable functions, use `unreached()`:

```rust
pub fn unwrap(self) -> (a: A)
    requires
        is_Some(self),
    ensures
        a == get_Some_0(self),
{
    match self {
        MyOption::Some(a) => a,
        MyOption::None => unreached(), // For unreachable branches in exec functions
    }
}
```

## Match in Proof Functions

For unreachable branches in proof functions, use `proof_from_false()`:

```rust
pub proof fn tracked_unwrap(tracked self) -> (tracked a: A)
    requires
        is_Some(self),
    ensures
        a == get_Some_0(self),
{
    match self {
        MyOption::Some(a) => a,
        MyOption::None => proof_from_false(), // For unreachable branches in proof functions
    }
}
```
