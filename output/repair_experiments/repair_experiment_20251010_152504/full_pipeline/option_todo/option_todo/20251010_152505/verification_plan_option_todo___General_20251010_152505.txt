## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code is an enum MyOption with open spec functions, plus methods needing requires/ensures.
- Multiple "TODO: add specification" and "TODO: add requires and ensures" markers are present.
- There is no mention of implementing or refining a "View" function.
- There is no class or struct requiring type invariants, only an enum.

Dependencies:
- The open spec functions (is_Some, is_None, get_Some_0, Or) all need their ensures clauses specified.
- The regular methods (or, is_some, is_none, as_ref, unwrap) also have "TODO" placeholders for requires/ensures.
- No additional dependencies on type invariants or custom data-structure invariants are identified.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
- The code does not contain a class/struct that requires invariants; it defines an enum instead.
- There are explicit "TODO: add specification" and "TODO: add requires/ensures" markers.
- There is no reference to "View" or "TODO: add View," hence no need for view inference or refinement.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No – not a class/struct, so no type invariants needed.
- proof_generation: No – there are no "TODO: add proof" or "TODO: add invariants" markers.
