## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code implements a TreeMap with insert/delete/lookups, accompanied by BST invariants.
- There are “TODO: add requires and ensures” placeholders for several methods and a “TODO: add proof” placeholder.
- A “View” trait is explicitly implemented for TreeMap, but its specification body is still missing.
- The TreeMap and Node structs already define a BST-type invariant (well_formed).

Identified Missing Components:
- The “View” methods remain unspecified (“TODO: add specification”).
- Functions such as new, insert, delete, get, and their helpers require requires/ensures clauses.
- Proof blocks are requested to show well-formedness and ensure BST properties during mutations.

Critical Verification Challenges:
- Properly specifying the “View” method so TreeMap’s abstract representation is recognized as a map.
- Completing requires/ensures and proofs for tree operations while maintaining BST invariants.

Dependencies:
- The well_formed property of Node and TreeMap underpins correctness for all CRUD operations.
- The “View” specification must align with as_map to ensure consistency between the abstract and concrete views.
- The “TODO: add proof” depends on completing the invariants and specifications, so proof_generation must follow those steps.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
This code explicitly implements a “View” trait (“impl<V> View for TreeMap<V>”), triggering the Full Sequence Workflow. The TreeMap and Node structs also require invariants to preserve BST properties. Multiple “TODO” items request proofs and specifications, confirming a need for all verification modules, ending with proof_generation.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes (TreeMap and Node are structs requiring BST invariants).
- proof_generation: Yes (there is a “TODO: add proof” marker).
