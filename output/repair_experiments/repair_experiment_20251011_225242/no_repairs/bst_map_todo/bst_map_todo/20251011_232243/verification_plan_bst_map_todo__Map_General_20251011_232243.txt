## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a TreeMap (and underlying Node) data structure, which is a BST-based map.
- The code explicitly implements the “View” trait for TreeMap, and there are several "TODO" placeholders for specifications and proofs.
- The data structure is partially verified, but requires completion of View specification, type invariants, and function specs.

Identified Missing Components:
- The view() body in the “impl View for TreeMap” is incomplete.
- Multiple functions lack requires/ensures clauses.
- There are explicit TODO markers for adding proofs.
- A type_invariant is present but further invariants or formal specs may be needed.

Critical Verification Challenges:
- Ensuring BST properties, especially for insertion and deletion.
- Refining the View representation of the TreeMap to match the associated map semantics.
- Proving well_formed invariants and their preservation through operations.

Dependencies:
- The Node and TreeMap data structures depend on a correct and complete view() implementation for verifying their map-based specs.
- The Node::well_formed property underpins the TreeMap::well_formed type invariant.
- The yet-to-be-created proofs (TODO marks) will rely on these invariants and function specs.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
The code contains an explicit "impl View for TreeMap" and requires a complete View-based approach. It also includes a struct data structure (Node and TreeMap) that needs invariants, and there are placeholders for function specifications. Since there is a "View" trait implementation, we must perform a full verification sequence that includes view_inference and view_refinement, plus we have "TODO: add proof" markers indicating proof_generation at the end.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – the code uses struct data (TreeMap, Node) and includes a type_invariant.
- proof_generation: Yes – there is a “TODO: add proof” marker in the code.
