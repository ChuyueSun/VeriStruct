## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code consists of free functions (binary_search, reverse, binary_search_no_spinoff) without any user-defined struct/class data structure.
- Each function includes “TODO: add specification” placeholders for missing requires/ensures.
- There are also “TODO: add invariants” placeholders for loop invariants, but these refer to function/loop correctness rather than type invariants.
- No references to “View” or other view-related functions.

Dependencies:
- All three functions rely on adding proper functional specifications and loop invariants.
- No dependency on any custom data structure or view abstraction.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
This code does not define or use any custom data structures requiring type invariants, and it does not require view functions. The placeholders explicitly request function specifications (“TODO: add specification”) and loop invariants. As no struct/class invariants are needed or “View” support is requested, the specification-only workflow is sufficient.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference
2. proof_generation  (appended because “TODO: add invariants” markers exist)

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No – there is no user-defined data structure requiring type invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes – the code explicitly includes “TODO: add invariants” comments.
```
