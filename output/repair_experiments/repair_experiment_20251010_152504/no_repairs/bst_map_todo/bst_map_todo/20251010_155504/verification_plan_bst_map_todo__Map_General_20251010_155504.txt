## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a TreeMap<V> and Node<V> data structure implementing a binary search tree.
- A View trait is explicitly implemented for TreeMap, but the specification bodies (as_map, view) are incomplete ("TODO: add specification").
- Several functions (new, insert, delete, get) also have "TODO: add requires and ensures" placeholders.
- There is a "TODO: add proof" marker in the TreeMap insert method.

Dependencies:
- The Node and TreeMap structs are closely coupled with their invariants (well-formed BST).
- The view() function for TreeMap depends on converting self.root to a Map via optional_as_map.
- The specification for each operation relies on maintaining the BST invariant and adjusting the Map abstraction accordingly.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
- The code explicitly implements the "View" trait for TreeMap, indicating a required View-based abstraction.
- This is a data structure (TreeMap, Node) with BST invariants, so inv_inference is also applicable.
- The presence of "TODO: add proof" requires a final proof_generation step.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes (the input is a struct data structure with BST invariants).
- proof_generation: Yes ("TODO: add proof" is present in the code).
