Current State:
- The code defines a trait implementation (ModPredicate) for InvariantPredicate but leaves the body of inv(k, v) unimplemented with a "TODO: add specification" comment.
- There is no request for a View function and no new data structure that requires a type invariant (ModPredicate is just an empty struct implementing a trait).
- There are no "TODO: add proof" or "TODO: add invariants" markers.

Dependencies:
- The verification of AtomicInvariant objects depends on the correctness of the inv(k, v) predicate for ModPredicate.
- No other special proof dependencies are indicated.

```

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
1. There is no indication that a View implementation is needed.
2. Although "struct ModPredicate" exists, it does not store data requiring a type invariant.
3. The only placeholder is "TODO: add specification," which fits a specification-only task.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No – there is no class/struct storing fields requiring a type invariant.
- proof_generation: No – there is no "TODO: add proof" or "TODO: add invariants" marker.
```
