## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a BST-like data structure (struct Node<V>) with operations (insert, delete, get).
- The "well_formed" method is missing its invariant implementation ("TODO: add invariant").
- Several methods (insert_into_optional, insert, delete_from_optional, delete_rightmost, get_from_optional, get) have "TODO: add requires and ensures" placeholders.
- No explicit "View" requirement or keyword is present.

Dependencies:
- The well_formed invariant is critical for all operations (insert, delete, get).
- Each operation’s pre- and postconditions (requires/ensures) depend on guaranteeing or preserving the BST property.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
- The code contains a struct (Node<V>) that requires type invariants ("TODO: add invariant").
- It also has specification-related placeholders ("TODO: add requires/ensures").
- There is no explicit mention of "View" or request to implement a View, so we do not use the Full Sequence Workflow.

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference
3. proof_generation  (added because the code has “TODO: add invariant”)

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – the Node struct requires BST invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes – “TODO: add invariant” is present in the code.
