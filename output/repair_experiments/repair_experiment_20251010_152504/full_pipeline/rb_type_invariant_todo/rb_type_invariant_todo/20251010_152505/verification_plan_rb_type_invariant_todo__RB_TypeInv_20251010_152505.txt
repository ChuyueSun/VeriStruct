## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a RingBuffer<T> struct which implements the "View" trait but lacks a proper view specification.
- The code includes multiple "TODO: add proof" and "TODO: add specification" markers, indicating missing proofs and function specifications.
- The RingBuffer<T> also has a type invariant placeholder marked by "TODO: add specification".
- Several methods (such as len, has_elements, is_full, enqueue, dequeue, available_len) also have commented placeholders for requires/ensures clauses.

Dependencies:
- The RingBuffer<T>'s view specification must match the data structure’s intended mathematical model.
- The type invariant for RingBuffer<T> depends on the ring, head, and tail fields.
- Each public method in RingBuffer<T> depends on correct invariants and function specs (requires/ensures).
- "TODO" markers for proof blocks signal the need for a final proof generation step.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
- The code explicitly implements the "View" trait for the RingBuffer<T> struct, triggering the Full Sequence Workflow.
- RingBuffer<T> is a data structure, so we also include the inv_inference step.
- The presence of "TODO: add proof" requires appending proof_generation at the end.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation  (appended because of "TODO: add proof"/"TODO: add specification")

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – the input is a struct (RingBuffer<T>) needing an invariant.
- proof_generation: Yes – there are "TODO: add proof" markers in the code.
