## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code introduces a RingBuffer struct, which implements the View trait.
- There are several TODO placeholders asking for specifications (requires/ensures) in methods and a View implementation, as well as proofs.
- Thus, we have both a need for invariants (RingBuffer is a struct) and a View specification.

Identified Missing Components:
- A fully-defined View function for RingBuffer (the impl View block is empty).
- Type invariant specifics for RingBuffer (currently marked as TODO).
- Requires/ensures clauses for various methods like len, has_elements, is_full, new, enqueue, dequeue, and available_len.
- Proof blocks where marked as “TODO: add proof.”

Critical Verification Challenges:
- Ensuring the data structure’s ring buffer properties are maintained (head-tail logic, wrap-around, etc.).
- Capturing these properties formally via type invariants and a correct mathematical View abstraction.
- Providing complete specifications and corresponding proofs.

Dependencies:
- The type invariants (inv) must be consistent with the ring buffer’s intended behavior and also align with the final View.
- The correctness of function specs depends on the ring buffer invariants and the internal representation exposed in the View.
- Proof blocks will rely on these specs to ensure all verification conditions are met.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
- The code explicitly implements a “View” trait and requires a specification (“// TODO: add specification” in the View impl).
- The data structure RingBuffer<T> is a struct, so we also need type invariants and function-level specs.
- “TODO: add proof” is present, indicating we must add a final proof_generation step.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference   (because RingBuffer<T> is a struct needing type invariants)
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation (due to “TODO: add proof” and “TODO: add invariants” markers)

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – the RingBuffer<T> struct requires a type_invariant and we have a TODO comment for it.
- proof_generation: Yes – the code has multiple “TODO: add proof” references.
```
