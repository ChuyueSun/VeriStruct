## Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines an enum MyOption but does not mention any invariant requirements (no "TODO: add invariants" found).
- There are multiple "TODO: add specification" and "TODO: add requires/ensures" markers for functions in MyOption.
- There is no mention of "View" or "TODO: add View" or "implement View."

Dependencies:
- The functions is_Some, is_None, get_Some_0, Or, etc. depend on properly defined specification clauses.
- No proof or invariant dependencies are indicated.

## Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
There is no request for type invariants, and no mention of or requirement for a View function. The code solely contains "TODO: add specification" and "TODO: add requires/ensures," which aligns with the Specification-Only Workflow.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No – there is no indication that type invariants are needed for MyOption.
- proof_generation: No – there are no "TODO: add proof" markers present.
