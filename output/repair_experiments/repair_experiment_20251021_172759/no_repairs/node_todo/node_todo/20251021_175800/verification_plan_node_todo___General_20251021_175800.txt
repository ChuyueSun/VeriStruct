Current State:
- The code defines a 'Node' struct representing a BST node and implements operations (insert, delete, get).
- The function "well_formed" lacks an invariant ("TODO: add invariant").
- Multiple functions (insert, delete, get) have "TODO: add requires and ensures" indicating missing specifications.
- No explicit "View" trait or "TODO: add View" is mentioned; the existing "as_map" and "optional_as_map" are not strictly-labeled "View" functions.

Dependencies:
- The BST invariant (well_formed) is central to all operations (insert, delete, get).
- Each operation's correctness depends on the BST property and the map representation (as_map).
- "Node::optional_as_map" and "Node::as_map" form the abstraction for verifying the node’s contents.

**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
This code involves a struct data structure (Node) requiring a BST invariant, and there are explicit TODOs for both invariants and function specifications. Since no "View" implementation is requested, the Full Sequence Workflow is not applicable. Therefore, we use the Invariant-First Workflow to establish invariants before refining function specifications.

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference
3. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes (the code defines a struct Node that needs a well_formed invariant).
- proof_generation: Yes ("TODO: add invariant" is present, indicating additional proofs are needed).
