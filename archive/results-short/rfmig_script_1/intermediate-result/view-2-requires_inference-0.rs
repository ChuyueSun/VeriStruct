It all depends on what kind of properties or behavior you want to verify. For instance:

• If you just want to ensure the function always returns the larger of the two values, you might add a simple postcondition (ensures) stating that the result equals the maximum of the two inputs (u8).  
• If you need deeper verification guarantees—perhaps about how this result is used in a larger module, or about invariants that must hold whenever this function is called—you would add more complex requires/ensures clauses or define an inv (invariant) that captures and enforces those properties.

Could you say more about your specific goals or the context of your code (e.g., how it’s being used, what correctness property you need proven)? That would make it easier to give concrete recommendations.
