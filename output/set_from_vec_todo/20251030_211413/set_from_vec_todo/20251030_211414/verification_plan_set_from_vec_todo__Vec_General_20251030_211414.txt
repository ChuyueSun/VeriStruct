## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a struct (VecSet) that includes a "view" function returning a Set<u64>.
- There are placeholders for requires/ensures clauses, indicating missing specifications.
- There is an explicit "TODO: add proof" in the insert method, demonstrating the need for proofs.
- The contains method has a "TODO: add invariant," showing the need for loop invariants.

Dependencies:
- The VecSet struct depends on its view function for logical representation.
- insert/contains depend on VecSet's invariants and specifications for correctness.
- The "view" function is central to verifying structural correspondence between the Rust Vec and the mathematical Set.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
- The code includes an explicit "view" function (pub closed spec fn view).
- There are multiple "TODO: add requires and ensures" placeholders indicating missing function specifications.
- VecSet is a struct, so we also include the inv_inference step.
- A "TODO: add proof" exists, which triggers an additional proof_generation step at the end.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes - VecSet is a struct requiring type invariants and loop invariants (the for loop in contains).
- proof_generation: Yes - "TODO: add proof" is present.
