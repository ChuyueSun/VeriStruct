## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- A struct VecSet is defined, containing a Vec<u64>.
- There is a "pub closed spec fn view()" indicating an explicit need for a View function.
- Several functions (new, insert, contains) contain "TODO: add requires and ensures" markers, indicating missing specifications.
- There is also a "TODO: add proof" in the insert method.
- A for-loop in contains suggests a possible invariant or loop assertion requirement.

Dependencies:
- The VecSet struct’s correctness hinges on properly defining its View function for abstraction.
- Each function (new, insert, contains) depends on correct specifications (requires/ensures).
- Final proofs may depend on the correctness of the View function and any type or loop invariants inferred.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
- The code explicitly includes a "pub closed spec fn view", satisfying the condition for a View implementation.
- There are "TODO: add requires and ensures" placeholders in multiple functions. Therefore, we need a comprehensive approach to cover views, invariants (as indicated in the code’s loop), and specifications.
- The VecSet is a struct, so including inv_inference is appropriate.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation  (added because of "TODO: add proof")

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – the input is a struct requiring invariants (e.g., the loop invariant in contains).
- proof_generation: Yes – there is a "TODO: add proof" in the insert method.
