## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- A “BitMap” struct is defined with a placeholder “spec fn view(&self) -> Seq<bool>” that explicitly needs to be implemented.
- Several functions (“from”, “get_bit”, “set_bit”, “or”) each have “TODO: add requires and ensures”.
- There is a “TODO: add proof” comment in the “set_bit” method indicating proof obligations remain.
- The code references “maintain specified invariants” in the documentation, implying that invariants may be needed for the data structure.

Dependencies:
- The “BitMap” struct depends on a well-defined view function for verification of the higher-level operations.
- The “set_bit” and “or” operations both rely on correctly implementing their respective specification (requires/ensures) and proven correctness (proof obligations).
- The “BitMap” invariants (if any) must be consistent with the “view” function to ensure correctness across all methods.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
The code explicitly contains a “spec fn view” that needs implementation. This triggers the Full Sequence Workflow (“view_inference → view_refinement → [inv_inference for struct] → spec_inference”). The “BitMap” is a struct, so “inv_inference” applies to determine or confirm any necessary type invariants. Additionally, there are “TODO: add proof” comments, so we append “proof_generation” as the final step.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – “BitMap” is a struct and likely requires invariants for “bits”.
- proof_generation: Yes – present “TODO: add proof” markers require final proof obligations.
```
