## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code includes a TreeMap and Node data structure that implement BST properties.
- The TreeMap implements a "View" trait, but its view function has a "TODO: add specification" placeholder.
- Several functions (insert, delete, get, etc.) have missing requires/ensures clauses.
- There is at least one "TODO: add proof" marker indicating that proof obligations are also missing.

Identified Missing Components:
- View specification bodies for TreeMap's "view" function.
- Requires/ensures clauses for TreeMap and Node methods like "insert", "delete", "get".
- Proof blocks for "TODO: add proof".

Critical Verification Challenges:
- Ensuring that BST invariants are preserved at each step of insert/delete.
- Verifying that the "view" implementation is correct and well-formed with respect to the data structure’s map abstraction.
- Properly specifying key function behaviors using requires/ensures.

Dependencies:
- The TreeMap’s as_map() relies on Node’s as_map() and optional_as_map() to correctly represent the BST as a Map.
- The user’s "view" function must match the TreeMap’s as_map() to remain consistent with the data type abstraction.
- Insertion and deletion correctness depend on the BST well_formed() invariant in Node.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
The code explicitly mentions and implements a "View" trait for the TreeMap, which requires a complete view-based verification sequence. Additionally, the data structure is a BST (a struct/class-based type), so inv_inference is applicable. There are also placeholders for added proofs and function specifications, which justifies a fully comprehensive approach.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – the input is a struct (TreeMap/Node) with a BST invariant.
- proof_generation: Yes – there is a "TODO: add proof" marker in the code.
