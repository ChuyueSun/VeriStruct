## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The struct "ModPredicate" implements the "InvariantPredicate" trait but lacks a formal body for its "inv" function (marked with "TODO: add specification").
- The code creates and uses "AtomicInvariant" objects tied to this predicate; the predicate’s correctness is crucial for the invariants on the stored values (e.g., ensuring even/odd values).
- There is no mention of any "View" functions or view-related requirements in the code.

Dependencies:
- The correctness of "AtomicInvariant::new(...)" calls depends on the predicate "ModPredicate::inv(k, v) → bool" being properly defined.
- The "test" function relies on the correctness of "inv" to maintain the expected parity invariants for k=0 (even) and k=1 (odd).

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
- We have a struct ("ModPredicate") that implements a predicate and thus serves as a data structure needing integrity constraints.
- The code includes a “TODO: add specification”, indicating missing requires/ensures-like content for "inv".
- There is no mention of "View" or any view-related requirements, so the Full Sequence Workflow is not needed.

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes — "ModPredicate" is a struct requiring a definition for its invariant predicate.
- proof_generation: No — there is no "TODO: add proof" or "TODO: add invariants" marker in the code.
