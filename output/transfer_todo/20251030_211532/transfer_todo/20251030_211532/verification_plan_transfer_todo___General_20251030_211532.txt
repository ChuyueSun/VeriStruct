## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code has a struct Account but no explicit requirement for type invariants.
- There is a placeholder comment "TODO: add requires and ensures" indicating that function specifications are needed.
- No mention of "View" or "TODO: add invariants" is present.

Dependencies:
- The function transfer depends on properly defined requires/ensures clauses related to the amount to be transferred and the resulting balances.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
- The code does not mention or request any View functions or type invariants.
- The only identified placeholder is "TODO: add requires and ensures."
- Therefore, only function specifications (requires/ensures) are needed, making the Specification-Only Workflow the best fit.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No (the struct does not explicitly require invariants, and no "TODO: add invariants" is found)
- proof_generation: No (no "TODO: add proof" placeholder is present)
