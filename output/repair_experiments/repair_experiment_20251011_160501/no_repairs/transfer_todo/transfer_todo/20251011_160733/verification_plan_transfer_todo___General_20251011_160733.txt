Current State:
- The code defines a simple Account struct and a transfer function with a placeholder "TODO: add requires and ensures."
- There is no mention or hint of requiring invariants for the Account struct itself.
- No View-related functionality or instructions appear in the code.

Dependencies:
- The transfer function depends on well-formed preconditions (requires) and postconditions (ensures) to maintain correctness of balances.
- There are no direct dependencies on invariants or view definitions.

```

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
Since there is a struct, but no mention of needing invariants or View-related definitions, and there is an explicit TODO to add requires/ensures, the Specification-Only Workflow is appropriate. The code does not require a View function or any invariants, so we only need to address the placeholders for function specifications.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No – the struct does not require an explicit invariant.
- proof_generation: No – there is no "TODO: add proof" or "TODO: add invariants" marker.
```
