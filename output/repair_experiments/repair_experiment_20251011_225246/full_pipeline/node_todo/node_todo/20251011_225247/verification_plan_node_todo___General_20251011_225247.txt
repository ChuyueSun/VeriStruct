## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a BST node struct (Node<V>) that clearly needs type invariants to enforce the BST ordering property.
- Multiple "TODO" markers indicate missing invariants for well_formed and missing requires/ensures clauses for insert, delete, and get methods.
- No explicit "View" implementation requirement (e.g., "implement View" or "TODO: add View") is found, although the code has open spec functions for as_map and optional_as_map.

Identified Missing Components:
- Invariants enforcing BST properties in well_formed.
- Requires and ensures for insert_into_optional, insert, delete_from_optional, get_from_optional, and get.
- Proofs or additional reasoning blocks for the "TODO: add invariant" references.

Critical Verification Challenges:
- Ensuring the BST property is formally captured (left < key < right).
- Verifying that after each operation, the data structure remains well-formed.
- Properly stating preconditions/postconditions so the proofs can succeed.

Dependencies:
- The well_formed specification underpins correctness in all node operations.
- Each insert/delete/get function’s correctness depends on well_formed and the type invariants it implies.
- Because the BST property is distributed across node connections, the correctness of one operation often relies on invariants of subtrees.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
- The code includes a struct Node<V> requiring type invariants to capture BST properties.
- There are explicit placeholders for "TODO: add requires/ensures" indicating specification is also needed.
- No explicit or implied request for a separate "View" implementation beyond the existing open spec functions, so Full Sequence Workflow is unnecessary.

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference
3. proof_generation  (appended because "TODO: add invariant" indicates additional proof work is needed)

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes (Struct data structure Node<V> requires invariants for BST property)
- proof_generation: Yes ("TODO: add invariant" is present, indicating final proof steps)
```
