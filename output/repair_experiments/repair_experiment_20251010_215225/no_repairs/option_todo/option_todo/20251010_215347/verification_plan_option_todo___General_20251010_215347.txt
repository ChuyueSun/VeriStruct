## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines an enum MyOption<A> with several open spec functions (is_Some, is_None, etc.) that contain "TODO: add specification" placeholders.
- There are also functions (or, is_some, is_none, as_ref, unwrap) with "TODO: add requires and ensures" placeholders.
- No invariants or “View” requirements appear in the code.
- No "TODO: add proof" or "TODO: add invariants" markers are present.

Identified Missing Components:
- The specification clauses for these open spec functions and public functions are not yet provided.

Critical Verification Challenges:
- The main gap is a lack of requires/ensures clauses and other function specification details.

Dependencies:
- The MyOption enum’s functions all depend on well-defined specifications to ensure correctness.
- No additional proof or invariant dependencies are evident.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
All placeholders are for "TODO: add specification" or "TODO: add requires and ensures," with no mention of type invariants or view functions. Hence, the code only needs specification inference, matching the criteria for the Specification-Only Workflow.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No – the code does not require type invariants or mention them.
- proof_generation: No – there is no "TODO: add proof" or "TODO: add invariants" marker present.
