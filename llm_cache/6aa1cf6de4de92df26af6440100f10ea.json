    "instruction": "You are an expert in Verus (verifier for rust). Your task is **Add `requires` and `ensures` to public functions**:\n   - Please change the return type of the function if it doesn't have a return type to `-> (retname: rettype)`.\n   - Analyze the semantics of the functions and append appropriate `requires` and `ensures` clauses to the method implementations.\n   - DO NOT just copy the implementation code. You may use `self.view().XXX` or `self@XXX` in the `ensures` clauses. If `self.view()` is a tuple, you can use `self@.i` to access the i-th element (zero index).\n   - DO NOT use `old` without consideration: \"only a variable binding is allowed as the argument to old\".\n   - DO NOT use `match` or `let` in the `ensures` clause.\n   - DO NOT add anything to `fn main`.\n   - You do not need to add `self.inv()` to the pre- and post-conditions of if `#[verifier::type_invariant]` is used before the `inv` definition.\n   - spec functions like View cannot have requires/ensures.\n\n# Verus Common Knowledge\n\n## Important Notes\n- Don't delete existing non-buggy `#[trigger]`!\n- Don't change \"unwind\" to `(unwind) as bool`!\n- Return the complete modified Rust code in your response without explanations.\n\n## Spec Functions\n1. No Direct Method Calls:\n   In a spec function, you cannot directly call instance methods such as vector.is_full().\n2. Use the @ Operator:\n   To invoke methods on a variable within a spec, first convert it to its specification-level representation View with @.\n3. Always use vector.len() instead of vector@.len().\n4. Simplify Boolean Conjunctions:\n   When combining multiple conditions, avoid excessive &&&. Fewer (or well-structured) conjunctions make the spec code easier to read and debug.\n\n## Operators\nVerus extends Rust logical operators with low-precedence forms that are especially helpful in specification code:\n\nStandard Operators: &&, ||, ==>, <==>\nLow-Precedence Variants: &&& and |||\n\nThe meaning of &&& is the same as && (logical AND), and ||| is the same as || (logical OR), but with lower precedence. This allows you to write conditions in a \"bulleted list\" style that remains grouped in a logical manner:\n\n```\n&&& a ==> b\n&&& c\n&&& d <==> e && f\n```\n\nis equivalent to:\n\n```\n(a ==> b) && c && (d <==> (e && f))\n```\n\nNote:\n- Implication (==>) and equivalence (<==>) bind more tightly than &&& and |||.\n- Using &&&/||| can make long specifications clearer by grouping logical clauses neatly.\n\n\n# Verus Requires and Ensures Guidelines\n\n## Formatting for `requires` and `ensures`\n\n```rust\nfn func(arg) -> rettype\n    requires\n        REQUIREMENT1,\n        REQUIREMENT2,\n        ...\n    ensures\n        ENSUREMENT1,\n        ENSUREMENT2,\n        if COND {\n            &&& ENSUREMENT3_1\n            &&& ENSUREMENT3_2\n        } else {\n            &&& ENSUREMENT4_1\n            &&& ENSUREMENT4_2\n        }\n        ...\n```\n\n- In requires, use `old(self)` to refer to the pre-state of an &mut variable.\n- When using the return value in an `ensures` clause, assign it a name if not already provided (change the return type of the function), e.g.:\n\n```rust\nfn func(arg) -> (retname: rettype)\n```\n\n- When using if-else blocks in ensures clauses, always use `&&&` instead of `&&` to connect multiple conditions, as shown in the example above.\n\n\n\n# Verus Sequence Knowledge\n\nSeq<T> is a mathematical sequence type used in specifications:\n\n- Building: Seq::empty(), seq![x, y, z], Seq::singleton(x)\n- Length: s.len()\n- Indexing: s[i] (0-based)\n- Subrange: s.subrange(lo, hi) gives elements from index lo (inclusive) to hi (exclusive)\n- Concatenation: s1 + s2\n- Update: s.update(i, v) returns a new sequence with index i updated to value v\n- Contains: s.contains(v) checks if v is in the sequence\n- Push/pop: s.push(v), s.pop() (returns new sequence, doesn't modify original)\n- Equality: Use `=~=` for sequence equality, NOT `==` (e.g., `seq1 =~= seq2`, `self@.0 =~= old(self)@.0.subrange(1, (old(self)@.0.len()) as int)`)\n\nYou can use forall or exists for properties over sequences.\n\n## Subrange Usage\n\n1. Cast indices to `int`: `self.head as int`, not just `self.head`\n2. Use `.subrange(start, end)`, not `seq[start..end]`\n3. Wrap complex expressions: `(..).subrange((expression) as int, ...)`\n4. For full length: `(sequence.len()) as int`\n",
