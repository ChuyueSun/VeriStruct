Current State:
- The BitMap struct is defined but lacks a proper “spec fn view”.
- The functions (from, get_bit, set_bit, or) have “TODO: add requires and ensures”.
- There is a pending “TODO: add proof” in set_bit(), indicating additional proof obligations.
- The code explicitly references a “view” function and a class/struct data structure, so a View is needed.

Dependencies:
- The BitMap::view() function is central for specifying how the internal bits map to a mathematical sequence of bool.
- Invariants in BitMap (if any) can reference or refine the view function.
- The functions from, get_bit, set_bit, and or all depend on having correct specifications and potentially rely on the Bitmap invariants.

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
The code includes a struct BitMap and explicitly requires a “view” function (“TODO: implement view”). Per the guidelines, the presence of a view function and a struct triggers the Full Sequence Workflow. Since BitMap is a data structure, we also include the inv_inference step. Additionally, we have “TODO: add proof”, so we will append proof_generation at the end.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – BitMap is a struct requiring possible invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes – “TODO: add proof” is present in the code.
