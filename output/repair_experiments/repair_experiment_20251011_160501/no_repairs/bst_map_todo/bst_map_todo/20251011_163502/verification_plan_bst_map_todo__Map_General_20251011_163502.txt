Current State:
- The code defines a TreeMap and Node data structure, along with a View implementation for TreeMap.
- There are multiple TODOs asking for specifications (requires/ensures) and a TODO to add a proof block.
- The core BST structure and invariants are partially specified but not fully verified.

Dependencies:
- The Node::well_formed predicate depends on optional_as_map to validate BST properties.
- The TreeMap’s as_map depends on Node’s as_map, while the View trait also requires a coherent map abstraction.
- Insert, delete, and get rely on Node’s insertion/deletion/search logic, each requiring well_formed.

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
There is a "View" trait explicitly implemented (impl<V> View for TreeMap<V>), indicating a need for a view-based abstraction. The code also includes class/struct data structures (Node and TreeMap) requiring type invariants and additional specifications. Hence, we apply the full sequence workflow with inv_inference.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference (because we have a struct with type invariants)
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation (due to "TODO: add proof" present in the code)

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – TreeMap and Node are struct data structures with a type_invariant.
- proof_generation: Yes – "TODO: add proof" is present in TreeMap::insert.
```
