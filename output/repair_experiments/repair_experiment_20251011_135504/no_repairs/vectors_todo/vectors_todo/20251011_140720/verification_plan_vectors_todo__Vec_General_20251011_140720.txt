Current State:
- The code defines free functions (binary_search, reverse, binary_search_no_spinoff) with “TODO: add specification” comments, indicating missing function specifications.
- There are “TODO: add invariants” placeholders for the while/for loops, indicating missing loop invariants.
- No custom struct or class is defined, and there is no mention of “View” requirements.
- No type invariants are requested, only function specs and loop invariants.

Dependencies:
- The three functions depend on properly defined requires/ensures clauses for correctness.
- Loop invariants (proof obligations) depend on the function specifications to establish and maintain correctness across iterations.

```

```markdown
**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
There is no custom class or struct needing a type invariant, so inv_inference is not required.
“TODO: add specification” placeholders indicate that only function specifications are needed, and no “View” requirement is mentioned.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference
2. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No – the code does not define a custom class or struct requiring type invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes – “TODO: add invariants” indicates loop invariants and accompanying proofs are needed.
```
