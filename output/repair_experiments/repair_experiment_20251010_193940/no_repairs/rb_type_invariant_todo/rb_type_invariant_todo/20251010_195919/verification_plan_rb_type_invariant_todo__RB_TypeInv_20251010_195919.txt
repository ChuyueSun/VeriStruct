## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a RingBuffer struct, which implements the View trait but lacks a proper view specification.
- The type_invariant function has a TODO marker and the ring buffer functions (len, has_elements, is_full, new, enqueue, dequeue, available_len) have TODO markers for requires/ensures and proofs.
- There is an explicit "impl View" requirement, which indicates a need for a full verification approach that includes establishing a proper View abstraction.
- The code contains “TODO: add proof” comments, indicating proof obligations are incomplete.

Identified Missing Components:
- Proper View function specification for RingBuffer<T>.
- Type invariant details.
- Requires/ensures function specifications.
- Proof bodies.

Critical Verification Challenges:
- Constructing an appropriate view function that represents the mathematical model of the ring buffer.
- Deriving and verifying invariants (particularly the ring buffer’s circular indexing).
- Providing proofs to satisfy the correctness conditions (e.g., operations preserving invariants).

Dependencies:
- The ring buffer’s correctness depends on the consistency between its data structure invariant and the View implementation.
- The function specifications depend on the type invariant to ensure ring operations are valid.
- Proof obligations depend on consistent use of the ring’s structure and its modular arithmetic properties.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
- The code explicitly contains an "impl View for RingBuffer<T>" with a TODO for its specification, which matches the requirement for a View-based verification approach.
- “TODO: add requires and ensures” and a type_invariant indicate that both invariants and function specs are needed.
- Since RingBuffer is a struct, the inv_inference step applies as part of the full workflow.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes, because the input is a struct (RingBuffer<T>) with a type_invariant placeholder.
- proof_generation: Yes, because the code contains “TODO: add proof” markers.
