Current State:
- The struct BitMap requires a “view” function to be fully specified; it is currently marked with “TODO: Implement the view function.”
- Several functions (from, get_bit, set_bit, or) are missing requires/ensures clauses.
- There are multiple “TODO: add proof” placeholders, indicating that additional proof blocks are needed.
- Overall, the code references an explicit “spec fn view” for BitMap, confirming that a View-based abstraction is needed.

Dependencies:
- The BitMap data structure will depend on a proper view() definition to represent its contents as a Seq<bool>.
- The set_bit64_proof and bit_or_64_proof are used for bit-vector correctness but also must integrate with the BitMap’s higher-level proofs.
- The verification of BitMap’s methods depends on both the view function and well-formed function specifications (requires/ensures).

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
The code explicitly contains a “spec fn view” method with a “TODO: Implement the view function,” so a View-based abstraction is required. Since BitMap is a struct, we include inv_inference. The code also contains "TODO: add proof," so we append proof_generation at the end.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes (BitMap is a struct; type invariants may be needed).
- proof_generation: Yes ("TODO: add proof" is present in the code).
