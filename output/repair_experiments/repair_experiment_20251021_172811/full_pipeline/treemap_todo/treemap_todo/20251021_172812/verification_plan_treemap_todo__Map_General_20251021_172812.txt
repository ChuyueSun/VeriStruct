Current State:
- This code defines a TreeMap data structure and a corresponding Node struct, along with a View implementation for TreeMap.
- Several "TODO: add specification" markers indicate missing requires/ensures clauses.
- There is also a "TODO: add proof" marker in the insert method.
- A well_formed type invariant is already present, but additional invariants may be desired.

Dependencies:
- The TreeMap<V> struct depends on the Node<V> struct for maintaining the BST.
- The TreeMap<V> implements View, tying the BST to a Map<u64, V> abstraction.
- The "TODO: add proof" depends on structural proofs (e.g., well_formed invariants).

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
The code explicitly contains a View implementation and uses the "View" keyword. Therefore, it requires the generation and refinement of a View function. Additionally, there is a Node/TreeMap data structure, which means inv_inference is needed. Because "TODO: add specification" text appears, we also need spec_inference. Finally, we append proof_generation because the code has a "TODO: add proof" marker.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – the code defines a struct data structure (TreeMap, Node) that includes type invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes – "TODO: add proof" is present.
