## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a struct VecSet containing a Vec<u64> and a "view" method that returns a Set<u64>, but the view function body is incomplete.
- Multiple TODOs are present indicating missing requires/ensures, invariants, and a proof block.
- The code uses vs@, which references the VecSet’s view; hence an explicit View function is part of the design.

Dependencies:
- The VecSet struct depends on a correct and complete View function for verification.
- The insert and contains functions depend on appropriate invariants and specifications.
- A proof is needed to justify correctness properties of insert.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
- The presence of an explicit "View" function (pub closed spec fn view) indicates that the code requires a View-based verification approach.
- The type VecSet is a data structure, so inv_inference is relevant.
- Multiple TODO comments request both requires/ensures (specs) and invariants, confirming the need for a comprehensive verification sequence.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference  (because VecSet is a data structure)
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation (due to "TODO: add proof")

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – VecSet is a struct requiring type invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes – There is a "TODO: add proof" marker in the code.
```
