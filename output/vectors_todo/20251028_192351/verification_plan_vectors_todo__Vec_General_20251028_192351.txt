## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code consists of free-standing functions (binary_search, reverse, binary_search_no_spinoff) operating on Vec<u64>, rather than a custom struct/class data structure.
- Multiple "TODO: add specification" and "TODO: add invariants" markers exist, indicating missing function specifications (requires/ensures clauses) and loop invariants.
- There is no mention of "View" or any data-structure-specific type invariants.

Dependencies:
- The functions depend on adding appropriate loop invariants to maintain correctness (e.g., bounding indices, preserving sortedness assumptions).
- The overall logic relies on correct function requires/ensures clauses for verifying usage consistency.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
- No user-defined data structures exist, so no type invariants are required.
- The file contains "TODO: add specification" references but does not involve "View" or data structure invariants.
- Since there are also "TODO: add invariants" markers (for loop invariants), we append proof_generation at the end.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference
2. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No – the code does not define a class/struct, so no type invariants are needed.
- proof_generation: Yes – the code contains "TODO: add invariants," which triggers final proof creation.
