Current State:
- The code defines a struct "FixedParity" and a corresponding trait function "inv" with a "TODO: add specification," indicating that a type-level invariant is missing.
- There is no separate "View" requirement or mention of "TODO: add View."
- The code otherwise compiles but is incomplete because the invariant for "FixedParity" is not specified.

Dependencies:
- "FixedParity" depends on having a correct invariant in its "inv" function.
- The rest of the RWLock code depends on the correctness of "inv" to maintain consistency.

**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
The code has a struct ("FixedParity") requiring a type-level invariant and contains a "TODO: add specification" placeholder. It does not request a "View" implementation explicitly, so the “Full Sequence Workflow” is not needed. Because there is a data structure plus a specification placeholder, we use the Invariant-First Workflow.

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – "FixedParity" is a struct needing an invariant in its "inv" function.
- proof_generation: No – the code does not contain a "TODO: add proof" or "TODO: add invariants" marker.
```
