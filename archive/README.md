# Verus Synthesis for Class Ring Buffer

_This is adaptedS from AutoVerus_

This repository contains code for automated Verus proof synthesis.

* `benchmarks`. This folder contains a number of Rust/Verus proof tasks, including all the 150 proof tasks referred to as <i>VerusBench</i> in our techreport.
* `code`. This folder contains the python code that does proof synthesis for Verus.
* `utils/lynette`. This folder contains a Verus parser that is written to support Verus proof synthesis.

## Pre-requisites

* You need to install [Verus](https://github.com/verus-lang/verus) before using this tool
* You may need to run `cargo install verusfmt` to install the Verus formatter

## Usage

```bash
python main.py --input ../rb_todo.rs --output rb_try.rs --config config.json
```
* `--input` specify a rust file that you want to generate Verus proof for (default: input.rs)
* `--output` specify a file that you want the final output to be written in (default: output.rs)
* `--config` specify your configuration. The format of this file is shown in config.json (default: config.json)
* `--repair` specify the number of debugging rounds before giving up (default: 10)
There are a few other parameters that you can set. Try `python main.py -h' to know more.

In addition to the final output, you will also see a folder prefixed by `intermediate-` that contains all the intermediate files generated by LLM and by our tool.
