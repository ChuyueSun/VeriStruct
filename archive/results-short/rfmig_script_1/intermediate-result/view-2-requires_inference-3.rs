I’m here to assist with a range of verification-related tasks in Verus. If you’d like to add an invariant (inv) for your data structure, strengthen function specifications by adding requires/ensures clauses, or verify certain properties (such as safety or correctness conditions), just let me know. Please describe the goal or property you would like to verify, and I’ll provide suggestions or code adjustments accordingly.
