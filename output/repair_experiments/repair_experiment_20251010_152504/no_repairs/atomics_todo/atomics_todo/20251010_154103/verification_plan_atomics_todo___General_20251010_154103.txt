Current State:
- The code defines a struct (Lock<T>) and a function (take) that both contain “TODO” placeholders for invariants and specifications.
- There is no mention of a required View implementation (no “View” keyword or “TODO: add View”).
- The Lock<T> data structure requires a type invariant (well_formed) and the function take needs requires/ensures clauses and a loop invariant.

Dependencies:
- The Lock<T> struct depends on its invariant (well_formed) for correct usage of field: AtomicBool<_, Option<T>, _>.
- The take function depends on the Lock<T> struct’s invariant and also needs to establish its own loop invariants and function specifications.

**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
We have a class/struct (Lock<T>) that requires a type invariant. There are also placeholders for function specifications (“TODO: add requires and ensures”) but no mention of a View implementation. Therefore, the Invariant-First Workflow (inv_inference → spec_inference) is the correct choice.
Since the code also has “TODO: add invariants,” we append proof_generation.

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference
3. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – Lock<T> is a struct with type invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes – “TODO: add invariants” marker is present.
```
