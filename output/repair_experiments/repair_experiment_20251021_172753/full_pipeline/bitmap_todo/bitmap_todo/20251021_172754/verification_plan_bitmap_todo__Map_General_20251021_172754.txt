Current State:
- The code defines a struct BitMap with a spec fn view(&self) -> Seq<bool> that is not yet implemented.
- There are several “TODO” markers, including “TODO: add proof” and “TODO: implement view”, indicating the need for specification details and proofs.
- No invariants are mentioned, but since we have a struct needing a View, a full workflow is triggered.

Dependencies:
- The BitMap struct’s view function will underpin the specifications of get_bit, set_bit, or, and from.
- Proofs in set_bit and or depend on the correctness of view and on any inferred invariants.
- The presence of a struct plus a view function requires the complete sequence of steps.

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
We have a struct BitMap that explicitly contains a “view” function (marked with “TODO: implement view”). This triggers the Full Sequence Workflow, which is used whenever a data structure includes or requires “View” implementation. As a struct is present, we include the inv_inference step.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – a struct BitMap exists, so type invariants may be inferred.
- proof_generation: Yes – the code has “TODO: add proof” markers.
```
