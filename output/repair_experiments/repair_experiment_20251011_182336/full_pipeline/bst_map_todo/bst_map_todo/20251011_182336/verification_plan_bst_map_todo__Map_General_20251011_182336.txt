## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a BST-based TreeMap and Node structs. It implements type invariants, partial function specifications, and a “View” trait for TreeMap, but several crucial pieces are still marked as TODO (e.g., requires/ensures clauses, missing proofs, and the “view” function body).
- Multiple “TODO: add specification” and “TODO: add proof” markers are present.
- The presence of “impl<V> View for TreeMap<V>” indicates an explicit need for a View function.

Identified Missing Components:
- The specification bodies for TreeMap::as_map, TreeMap::view, Node/TreeMap insertion/deletion/look-up functions (requires/ensures clauses).
- Proof obligations where “TODO: add proof” is noted.

Critical Verification Challenges:
- Ensuring the BST property via type invariants for all operations.
- Providing the correct View function to represent TreeMap as a Map in specs.
- Generating proof code to maintain well-formedness after insertions/deletions.
- Synthesizing complete function specifications so that the verification conditions (especially around the BST invariants and map equality) are provable.

Dependencies:
- The TreeMap::view depends on the well_formed property in order to justify correctness of the returned map abstraction.
- The Node::as_map and Node::optional_as_map are the basis for the entire TreeMap’s specification.
- Ensuring each insert/delete operation is well-formed requires the type invariant in TreeMap, plus correct usage of Node’s well_formed checks.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
Because the code explicitly contains a View implementation (“impl<V> View for TreeMap<V>”) and includes “TODO: add specification” for the view, it requires a View function and refinement. There are also struct data types (Node and TreeMap), so we include inv_inference. The presence of “TODO: add proof” means we must append proof_generation at the end.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes, because TreeMap and Node are structs needing type invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes, because “TODO: add proof” markers are present in the code.
