Current State:
- The code defines a Lock<T> struct (via struct_with_invariants!), which indicates we have a data structure needing invariants.
- There are clear specification placeholders: "TODO: add specification", "TODO: add requires and ensures", and "TODO: add invariants"; hence function specifications and invariants are needed.
- No "View" keywords or "implement View" directives, so a View-based verification is not required.

Dependencies:
- The Lock<T> struct depends on invariants (well_formed) and correct function specs (take).
- The function take depends on correct invariants and specification conditions to ensure it preserves the Lock<T> data structure’s correctness.

**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
We have a struct data structure (Lock<T>) that requires type invariants, and we also have specification-related placeholders (e.g., "TODO: add requires and ensures"). There is no need for a View implementation as "View" is never mentioned. Therefore, the Invariant-First Workflow is appropriate.

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference
3. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes - the Lock<T> struct needs invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes - the code includes “TODO: add invariants” (and other proof-related TODOs).
```
