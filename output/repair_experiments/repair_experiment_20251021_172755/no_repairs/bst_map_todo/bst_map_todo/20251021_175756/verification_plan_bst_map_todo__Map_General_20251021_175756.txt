## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a TreeMap and Node data structure for a binary search tree (BST), including a type invariant for well-formedness.
- The View trait is partially implemented for TreeMap but is missing its specification body.
- Many functions have “TODO” placeholders to add specifications (requires/ensures) and proofs.
- A “TODO: add proof” marker indicates that proof generation is needed.

Dependencies:
- TreeMap depends on the Node struct for its BST operations (insert, delete, get).
- Node and TreeMap each have map abstractions that must align with the BST invariant.
- The View trait for TreeMap must yield a consistent map view corresponding to the as_map and well_formed properties.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
The code explicitly implements the View trait ("impl<V> View for TreeMap<V>") and includes "TODO: add specification" for the view function, indicating a View-based approach is required. Furthermore, there is a struct-based data structure (TreeMap and Node) needing type invariants and specifications, and we have “TODO: add proof” markers, which triggers the proof_generation step at the end.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes. A struct data structure (TreeMap<Node<V>>) with BST properties and a type_invariant is present.
- proof_generation: Yes. There are “TODO: add proof” markers in the code.
