## Instruction

You are an expert in Verus (verifier for rust). Your task is to generate a View function for the given module.

The View is the mathematical abstraction of a data structure - it captures the ESSENTIAL LOGICAL STATE,
not just the implementation details.

**STEP 1: Identify the Data Structure's Purpose**

Ask yourself: What does this structure represent logically?
- A collection of elements? → Likely Seq<T>, Set<T>, or Map<K,V>
- A value with constraints? → Might need tuple to track both
- Multiple independent concepts? → Definitely needs tuple

**STEP 2: Count Independent Logical Aspects**

Analyze the struct fields to identify CONCEPTUAL aspects (not just field count):

Example: Counter with fields { value: u64, max: u64 }
- value, max = 2 fields
- Logically:
  * Current value (changes with operations)
  * Maximum allowed (constraint, doesn't change)
- = 2 independent aspects → need 2-tuple: (nat, nat)

Example: Stack with fields { data: Vec<T>, max_capacity: usize }
- data, max_capacity = 2 fields
- Logically:
  * Stack contents (the actual data stored)
  * Capacity limit (maximum size allowed)
- = 2 independent aspects → need 2-tuple: (Seq<T>, nat)

Example: SimpleList with fields { data: Vec<T> }
- data = 1 field
- Logically: just a sequence of elements
- = 1 aspect → simple Seq<T>

Example: Circular structure with fields { storage: Vec<T>, start_index: usize, end_index: usize }
- storage, start_index, end_index = 3 fields
- Logically:
  * The actual content stored (derived from storage + indices together)
  * Total capacity of the storage (fixed property)
- = 2 independent aspects → need 2-tuple: (Seq<T>, usize)

**STEP 3: Choose View Type Based on Analysis**

Single Type (not a tuple):
- Use when the structure represents ONE logical concept
- Examples:
  * List/Array/Vector → Seq<T>
  * Set operations → Set<T>
  * Key-value mapping → Map<K,V>
  * Bitmap → Seq<bool>

Tuple Type (T1, T2):
- Use when the structure has MULTIPLE independent logical aspects
- Common patterns:
  * Content + Capacity: (Seq<T>, nat) or (Seq<T>, usize)
    - When: Structure stores elements with a capacity limit
    - Examples: BoundedStack, bounded buffers/queues
  * Value + Constraint: (nat, nat)
    - When: Tracking a value with a maximum/minimum
    - Examples: BoundedCounter, indices with bounds
  * Data + Metadata: (MainType, MetadataType)
    - When: Primary data plus auxiliary information
    - First element: the main data (Seq, Map, Set, etc.)
    - Second element: size/capacity/constraints/properties

**STEP 4: Implement the View**

Based on your analysis:

```rust
impl<T: Copy> View for StructName<T> {
    type V = // Your chosen type from Step 3

    closed spec fn view(&self) -> Self::V {
        // Implementation that extracts the logical state
        // - For Seq<T>: convert storage to sequence
        // - For tuples: construct tuple with each aspect
        // - Use @ to get spec view of Vec/other types
    }
}
```

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- The View should be SIMPLER than the implementation (abstraction!)
- Fill in only the `/* TODO: part of view */` or empty View trait implementations
- Tuple size should generally be LESS than field count (true abstraction)
- Don't include derivable information (e.g., length can be computed from sequence)
- For `Vec` type variables, use `vec@` to get their Seq<T> view
- Do NOT use `reveal` keyword in the View implementation
- Think about what information is ESSENTIAL for specifications

**REASONING FRAMEWORK:**

Before generating, explicitly consider:
1. "This structure has [N] fields"
2. "Logically, it represents [X] independent concepts"
3. "The essential information is: [list the aspects]"
4. "Therefore, View type should be: [your choice]"

Mathematical types in Verus:
- Scalars: bool, int, nat
- Collections: Seq<T>, Set<T>, Map<K,V>
- Tuples: (T1, T2), (T1, T2, T3), etc.
- Combinations allowed: (Seq<T>, nat), (Map<K,V>, Set<K>), etc.

**CRITICAL: Ensure ALL delimiters are properly balanced:**
- Every opening brace { must have a matching closing brace }
- Every opening parenthesis ( must have a matching closing parenthesis )
- Every opening bracket [ must have a matching closing bracket ]
- Every impl block must be properly closed

Return the ENTIRE file with your changes integrated into the original code.

# Verus Common Knowledge

## Important Notes
- ALWAYS use parentheses whenever possible for clarity!
- Don't delete existing non-buggy `#[trigger]`!
- Don't change "unwind" to `(unwind) as bool`!
- Return the complete modified Rust code in your response without explanations.
- Keep top level docstrings at the top of the file, before `verus! {`. Do not place them after the `verus! {` declaration.
- Don't change any function signatures.

## Spec Functions
1. No Direct Method Calls:
   In a spec function, you cannot directly call instance methods such as vector.is_full().
2. Use the @ Operator:
   To invoke methods on a variable within a spec, first convert it to its specification-level representation View with @.
3. Always use vector.len() instead of vector@.len().
4. Simplify Boolean Conjunctions:
   When combining multiple conditions, avoid excessive &&&. Fewer (or well-structured) conjunctions make the spec code easier to read and debug.
5. Parentheses Usage:
   ALWAYS wrap conditions in parentheses, even for simple expressions. This makes precedence explicit and prevents errors.

## Proof Blocks - CRITICAL SYNTAX RULES

**🚫 NEVER use executable control flow (if/else/match) inside `proof { }` blocks!**

Proof blocks are spec-level contexts. They can only contain:
- `assert(...)` statements
- `assume(...)` statements
- Lemma/proof function calls
- Variable bindings with spec expressions

❌ **WRONG - Executable if/else in proof:**
```rust
proof {
    if condition { assert(x); } else { assert(y); }  // SYNTAX ERROR!
}
```

✅ **CORRECT - Use implication instead:**
```rust
proof {
    assert(condition ==> x);
    assert(!condition ==> y);
}
```

❌ **WRONG - Executable match in proof:**
```rust
proof {
    match opt { Some(v) => assert(v > 0), None => {} }  // SYNTAX ERROR!
}
```

✅ **CORRECT - Use implication or spec-level reasoning:**
```rust
proof {
    assert(opt.is_Some() ==> opt.unwrap() > 0);
}
```

## Operators
Verus extends Rust logical operators with low-precedence forms that are especially helpful in specification code:

Standard Operators: &&, ||, ==>, <==>
Low-Precedence Variants: &&& and |||

The meaning of &&& is the same as && (logical AND), and ||| is the same as || (logical OR), but with lower precedence. This allows you to write conditions in a "bulleted list" style that remains grouped in a logical manner:

```
&&& a ==> b
&&& c
&&& d <==> e && f
```

is equivalent to:

```
(a ==> b) && c && (d <==> (e && f))
```

Note:
- Implication (==>) and equivalence (<==>) bind more tightly than &&& and |||.
- Using &&&/||| can make long specifications clearer by grouping logical clauses neatly.


# Verus View Function Guidelines

## 🚨 CRITICAL RULE: Check Tuple Size vs Field Count

**If the struct has N fields and the View type is an N-tuple, the view is TRIVIAL and MUST be refined!**

Examples:
  - ❌ TRIVIAL: `struct {ring, head, tail}` → `type V = (Seq<T>, nat, nat)` (3 fields, 3-tuple = NO abstraction)
  - ✅ GOOD: `struct {ring, head, tail}` → `type V = (Seq<T>, nat)` (3 fields, 2-tuple = ABSTRACTION!)
  - ✅ GOOD: `struct {data, len}` → `type V = Seq<T>` (2 fields, single type = ABSTRACTION!)

**Rule:** Tuple size MUST be STRICTLY LESS than field count to show true abstraction!

## View Refinement Guidelines
1. A good View abstraction should:
   - Represent the essential state of the data structure, not just copy its fields
   - Hide implementation details while preserving behavior
   - Be as simple as possible while being complete
   - **Have fewer elements in the tuple than fields in the struct** (or use a single non-tuple type)

2. Common refinements:
   - For collections (arrays, lists): Use Seq<T> instead of raw arrays
   - For indices: Use meaningful representations (e.g., range of valid elements)
   - For flag fields: Consider if they can be derived from other state
   - **Combine related fields into semantic abstractions** (e.g., ring+head+tail → active_elements)

3. Avoid redundancy:
   - Only include fields necessary for specification
   - Derive computable properties in method ensures clauses, not in the view
   - **Don't just wrap every field in a tuple - that's not abstraction!**

4. Prefer mathematical types over concrete types when possible


# Verus Sequence Knowledge

Seq<T> is a mathematical sequence type used in specifications:

- Building: Seq::empty(), seq![x, y, z], Seq::singleton(x)
- Length: s.len()
- Indexing: s[i] (0-based)
- Subrange: s.subrange(lo, hi) gives elements from index lo (inclusive) to hi (exclusive)
- Concatenation: s1 + s2
- Update: s.update(i, v) returns a new sequence with index i updated to value v
- Contains: s.contains(v) checks if v is in the sequence
- Push/pop: s.push(v), s.pop() (returns new sequence, doesn't modify original)
- Equality: Use `=~=` for sequence equality, NOT `==` (e.g., `seq1 =~= seq2`, `self@.0 =~= old(self)@.0.subrange(1, (old(self)@.0.len()) as int)`)

You can use forall or exists for properties over sequences.

## CRITICAL: Postconditions for Seq<T> Update Operations

**For functions that update a single element in a sequence-based view**:

**✅ PREFER** - Use `.update()` for succinct, provable specifications:
```rust
fn update_element(&mut self, idx: usize, value: T)
    requires
        idx < old(self)@.len(),
    ensures
        self@ == old(self)@.update(idx as int, value),  // ✅ Succinct!
```

**❌ AVOID** - Verbose element-wise specifications (makes proofs much harder):
```rust
ensures
    self@.len() == old(self)@.len(),
    forall|i: int| 0 <= i && i < self@.len() && i != idx as int ==> self@[i] == old(self)@[i],
    self@[idx as int] == value,
```

**Why `.update()` is better**:
1. More concise and readable
2. Directly matches proof patterns (pairs with `assert_seqs_equal!`)
3. Easier for Verus SMT solver to reason about
4. Standard pattern in Verus for sequence modifications

**When to use this pattern**:
- Any function that modifies exactly one position in a Seq-based view
- After operations that update a single element (e.g., `self.data.set(index, value)`)
- Functions with postconditions about changing one element while preserving others

## Subrange Usage

1. Cast indices to `int`: `self.head as int`, not just `self.head`
2. Use `.subrange(start, end)`, not `seq[start..end]`
3. Wrap complex expressions: `(..).subrange((expression) as int, ...)`
4. For full length: `(sequence.len()) as int`


# Verus Set Usage Guide

## Overview
`Set<A>` is a specification type representing mathematical sets. Sets can be finite or infinite and are used primarily in specifications (spec functions, requires/ensures clauses).

## Construction

```rust
// Empty set
let s1 = Set::<A>::empty();

// Full set (all elements of type A)
let s2 = Set::<A>::full();

// Set from predicate
let s3 = Set::new(|x: nat| x < 10);

// Set literal using macro
let s4 = set![1, 2, 3, 4];
```

## Core Operations

```rust
// Check membership
s.contains(x)          // returns bool
s has x                // alternative syntax

// Insert/remove elements
s.insert(x)            // returns new set with x added
s.remove(x)            // returns new set with x removed

// Set operations
s1.union(s2)           // or s1 + s2
s1.intersect(s2)       // or s1 * s2
s1.difference(s2)      // or s1 - s2
s.complement()         // returns complement of s
s.filter(f)            // filter by predicate f

// Subset relation
s1.subset_of(s2)       // or s1 <= s2
```

## Finite Sets

```rust
// Check finiteness
s.finite()             // returns bool

// Operations on finite sets
s.len()                // cardinality (requires s.finite())
s.choose()             // picks arbitrary element

// Useful predicates
s.disjoint(s2)         // s and s2 have no common elements
```

## Equality

Use extensional equality `=~=` to compare sets:
```rust
ensures s1 =~= s2      // s1 and s2 contain same elements
```

## Common Axioms

Key broadcast axioms automatically available:
- `axiom_set_insert_same`: `s.insert(a).contains(a)`
- `axiom_set_remove_same`: `!s.remove(a).contains(a)`
- `axiom_set_union`: `s1.union(s2).contains(a) == (s1.contains(a) || s2.contains(a))`
- `axiom_set_ext_equal`: `s1 =~= s2 <==> forall|a| s1.contains(a) == s2.contains(a)`

Use `broadcast use group_set_axioms;` to enable all set axioms in a proof block.

## Example Usage

```rust
proof fn example_set_proof() {
    let s1 = set![1, 2, 3];
    let s2 = set![3, 4, 5];

    assert(s1.insert(4).contains(4));
    assert(s1.union(s2).contains(1));
    assert(s1.intersect(s2) =~= set![3]);
    assert(s1.finite() && s1.len() == 3);
}
```

## verification_plan

## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a struct (VecSet) which includes a function named "view" returning Set<u64>.
- The "view" function is incomplete; it has a TODO to add requires/ensures.
- The functions (new, insert, contains) all have TODO placeholders for specifications.
- Additional TODOs indicate a need for proofs and invariants.

Dependencies:
- The VecSet struct depends on a correct and complete view function to maintain consistency with its abstract set representation.
- The insert and contains methods must be consistent with the abstract set specified by the view function.
- The presence of “TODO: add proof” and “TODO: add invariant” tasks indicates that proofs and invariants are required for verification completeness.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
- The code explicitly includes a "View" function ("pub closed spec fn view"), indicating that a View-based refinement is required.
- The code also has a struct (VecSet) that likely requires type invariants.
- Multiple TODOs mention adding requires/ensures and proofs, confirming the need for complete verification steps including specification and proof generation.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation (added because of "TODO: add proof" and "TODO: add invariant")

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes (the code defines a struct VecSet requiring invariants)
- proof_generation: Yes (TODO markers explicitly request proof additions)
