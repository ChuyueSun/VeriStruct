Your mission is to fix the syntax error in the following Verus code.

Look carefully at the error message and location to identify the syntax issue. Common syntax errors include:
1. Missing or misplaced parentheses, braces, or brackets
2. Missing or incorrect semicolons or commas
3. Incorrect use of operators or methods
4. Incorrect function or method call syntax
5. Incorrect use of generics or type parameters
6. Incorrect use of Verus-specific syntax (like @, spec, proof, etc.)

Fix ONLY the part of the code with the syntax error, and leave the rest unchanged.
Response with the Rust code only, do not include any explanation.

# Verus Common Knowledge

## Important Notes
- ALWAYS use parentheses whenever possible for clarity!
- Don't delete existing non-buggy `#[trigger]`!
- Don't change "unwind" to `(unwind) as bool`!
- Return the complete modified Rust code in your response without explanations.
- Keep top level docstrings at the top of the file, before `verus! {`. Do not place them after the `verus! {` declaration.
- Don't change any function signatures.

## Spec Functions
1. No Direct Method Calls:
   In a spec function, you cannot directly call instance methods such as vector.is_full().
2. Use the @ Operator:
   To invoke methods on a variable within a spec, first convert it to its specification-level representation View with @.
3. Always use vector.len() instead of vector@.len().
4. Simplify Boolean Conjunctions:
   When combining multiple conditions, avoid excessive &&&. Fewer (or well-structured) conjunctions make the spec code easier to read and debug.
5. Parentheses Usage:
   ALWAYS wrap conditions in parentheses, even for simple expressions. This makes precedence explicit and prevents errors.

## Proof Blocks - CRITICAL SYNTAX RULES

**🚫 NEVER use executable control flow (if/else/match) inside `proof { }` blocks!**

Proof blocks are spec-level contexts. They can only contain:
- `assert(...)` statements
- `assume(...)` statements
- Lemma/proof function calls
- Variable bindings with spec expressions

❌ **WRONG - Executable if/else in proof:**
```rust
proof {
    if condition { assert(x); } else { assert(y); }  // SYNTAX ERROR!
}
```

✅ **CORRECT - Use implication instead:**
```rust
proof {
    assert(condition ==> x);
    assert(!condition ==> y);
}
```

❌ **WRONG - Executable match in proof:**
```rust
proof {
    match opt { Some(v) => assert(v > 0), None => {} }  // SYNTAX ERROR!
}
```

✅ **CORRECT - Use implication or spec-level reasoning:**
```rust
proof {
    assert(opt.is_Some() ==> opt.unwrap() > 0);
}
```

## Operators
Verus extends Rust logical operators with low-precedence forms that are especially helpful in specification code:

Standard Operators: &&, ||, ==>, <==>
Low-Precedence Variants: &&& and |||

The meaning of &&& is the same as && (logical AND), and ||| is the same as || (logical OR), but with lower precedence. This allows you to write conditions in a "bulleted list" style that remains grouped in a logical manner:

```
&&& a ==> b
&&& c
&&& d <==> e && f
```

is equivalent to:

```
(a ==> b) && c && (d <==> (e && f))
```

Note:
- Implication (==>) and equivalence (<==>) bind more tightly than &&& and |||.
- Using &&&/||| can make long specifications clearer by grouping logical clauses neatly.


additional knowledge:
IMPORTANT:
1. Don't change the anything in immutable function(s): . Instead, consider adjusting the preconditions or postconditions of other functions or methods.
2. Don't delete existing non-buggy `#[trigger]`, `use` statements, main function.

Syntax error:

Code
```
Looking at the error messages, I can see that several `spec` functions are declared with return types but have empty bodies, causing them to implicitly return `()` instead of the expected types.

The functions with missing implementations are:
1. `is_Some` - should return `bool`
2. `is_None` - should return `bool`
3. `get_Some_0` - should return `A`
4. `Or` - should return `MyOption<A>`

I need to add the appropriate match expressions to these spec functions:
