### Step 1: Analyze the task

This code defines a custom data structure (a doubly-linked list) with explicit “Node” pointers and a ghost state that keeps track of these pointers and their relationships. The file clearly includes a placeholder for a “view” function (the function “pub closed spec fn view(&self) -> Seq<V>”), which suggests it must eventually return the abstract sequence of values stored in the list. Furthermore, there are placeholders for additional specifications and invariants—for example, “spec fn prev_of(...), spec fn next_of(...), spec fn well_formed_node(...).” Because this data structure requires a formal “view” representation (and invariants to ensure well-formedness), the Full Sequence Workflow is the most appropriate.

### Step 2: Choose the Workflow

**Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow  
**Explanation:** This doubly linked list is a nontrivial data structure that needs a proper “view” function abstraction (for the abstract sequence of data in the list) as well as loop/data invariants to confirm its well-formedness. Therefore, the verified approach is to synthesize and refine its view, then infer the necessary invariants, and finally add the function specifications.
