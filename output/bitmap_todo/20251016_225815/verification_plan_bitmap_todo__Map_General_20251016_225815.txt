## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code includes a “BitMap” struct with incomplete verification elements:
  - A “view” function is declared but missing its implementation.
  - Functions lack requires/ensures clauses.
  - There are TODO markers for adding proofs.
- “View” is explicitly mentioned and is central to the data structure’s spec correctness.

Identified Missing Components:
- A clearly defined “view” specification (mathematical abstraction) for the bitmap.
- Invariant candidates for the “BitMap” struct (if necessary).
- Requires and ensures clauses for methods (from, get_bit, set_bit, or).
- Additional proof blocks where TODO comments appear.

Critical Verification Challenges:
- Correctly implementing the “view” function to reflect the 64-bit packing/unpacking of bits.
- Generating and refining accurate invariants if the data structure demands them.
- Adding the necessary proofs (“TODO: add proof”) for bitwise operations and loop invariants.

Dependencies:
- The “view” function influences correctness of other methods, which rely on the abstracted bit-sequence.
- Type invariants may depend on the size or structure of the bits vector.
- Proofs for set_bit and or depend on the correctness of the “view” function and specification clauses.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
This code explicitly contains a “view” function (spec fn view) for the “BitMap” struct. According to the rules, the presence of a “View” implementation requirement mandates the full sequence workflow. Additionally, “BitMap” is a struct, so we include the optional inv_inference step. Multiple “TODO: add proof” markers also require a final proof_generation step.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes (the code includes a struct, so invariants may be relevant.)
- proof_generation: Yes (“TODO: add proof” markers are present in the code.)
```
