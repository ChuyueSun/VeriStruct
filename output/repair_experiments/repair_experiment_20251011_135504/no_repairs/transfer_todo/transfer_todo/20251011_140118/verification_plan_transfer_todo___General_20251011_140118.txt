## 1. Analysis Summary
Current State:
- The code defines a simple struct Account with a balance field and a transfer function.
- There is a "TODO: add requires and ensures" placeholder in the transfer function.
- No invariants or View functions are mentioned, and there is no "TODO: add proof" note.

Dependencies:
- The transfer function depends on valid input constraints (e.g., sufficient balance).
- No other complex dependencies or data-structure invariants are identified.

## 2. Verification Plan
**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
Only "TODO: add requires and ensures" is present with no mention of invariants or View
requirements. While there is a struct (Account), there is no explicit request for
type invariants ("TODO: add invariants") or proof obligations ("TODO: add proof").
Hence, using Specification-Only Workflow is sufficient to address the specification
placeholders for the transfer function.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No – the code does not request or require invariants
- proof_generation: No – there is no “TODO: add proof” or “TODO: add invariants”
```
