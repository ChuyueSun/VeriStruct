Current State:
- The code defines a struct (ModPredicate) implementing the InvariantPredicate trait but leaves its inv function unimplemented ("TODO: add specification").
- The AtomicInvariant usage in test() relies on the inv function to ensure even/odd constraints but is missing the formal definition of those constraints.
- No explicit View functions or references appear in the code, so a View-based workflow is unnecessary.

Dependencies:
- The struct ModPredicate’s inv function is critical for the AtomicInvariant correctness.
- The function test() relies on ModPredicate::inv(k, v) to hold the even/odd property depending on k.

**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
Because the code contains a struct (ModPredicate) and requires a specification ("TODO: add specification") for the inv function, it qualifies for Invariant-First Workflow. There is no mention of View functions or any "View" requirement, so we do not use the Full Sequence workflow.

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – ModPredicate is a struct needing invariants.
- proof_generation: No – there is no "TODO: add proof" or "TODO: add invariants" marker in the code.
