## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- A RingBuffer<T> struct is present, with a “TODO: add specification” marker in the View implementation.
- There are also “TODO: add requires and ensures” markers in multiple methods, along with “TODO: add proof.”
- Hence, there is a clear need for both type invariants and specifications, plus an explicit View function.

Identified Missing Components:
- View function body for the RingBuffer struct.
- Type invariants for RingBuffer (the inv() function is a placeholder).
- Requires/ensures clauses for methods such as len, is_full, etc.
- Proof bodies (marked by “TODO: add proof”).

Critical Verification Challenges:
- Ensuring the ring buffer invariant is established and maintained.
- Providing a complete, formal View abstraction.
- Specifying function pre- and postconditions to verify enqueue/dequeue operations.
- Generating proofs to maintain consistency with the ring buffer’s invariants and specification.

Dependencies:
- RingBuffer<T> → needs the new View function.
- RingBuffer<T> methods → need consistent specifications that align with the View and the invariant.
- Proof blocks → depend on correct invariants and function specs.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
We must implement a View (the code explicitly has “impl<T: Copy> View for RingBuffer<T>”) and there are placeholders for both invariants and specification. The RingBuffer is a struct, so we also include the optional inv_inference step. Finally, “TODO: add proof” markers necessitate an additional proof_generation step.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes, because RingBuffer<T> is a struct requiring a type invariant.
- proof_generation: Yes, because “TODO: add proof” and “TODO: add invariants” markers are present.
