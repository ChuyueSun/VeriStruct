## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- There is a struct "FixedParity" implementing the "RwLockPredicate<u64>" trait, but its "inv" function contains a "TODO: add specification" placeholder.
- No separate type invariants or "View" requirements are present in the code.
- The code does not request a "View" function or mention any "TODO: add proof" or "TODO: add invariants."

Dependencies:
- The "inv" function in "FixedParity" depends on providing a proper specification relating the parity field and the input value.
- No additional dependencies (e.g., View or type invariants) were identified.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
Since there is no explicit requirement for a View implementation, and the only placeholder is "TODO: add specification" for the "inv" function, the Specification-Only Workflow is appropriate. The struct does not require added type invariants, and there are no "TODO: add invariants" markers to justify an Invariant-First approach.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No (the struct does not require new type invariants)
- proof_generation: No (no "TODO: add proof" or "TODO: add invariants" markers exist)
```
