## System
# Verus Verification Planner

You are an expert in formal verification using Verus, a Rust-based verification framework. Your task is to analyze Verus code and determine the optimal verification strategy.

## Context


## Available Verification Modules
- **view_inference**: Generate a View function for the data structure's mathematical abstraction
- **view_refinement**: Refine an existing View function to improve its mathematical abstraction
- **inv_inference**: Generate invariant functions for the data structure
- **spec_inference**: Infer requires and ensures clauses for functions
- **proof_generation**: Generate proofs for Verus functions
- **repair_syntax**: Repair syntax errors, including Seq-related syntax issues
- **repair_assertion**: Repair assertion failures by adding proofs or modifying pre/post conditions
- **repair_precond**: Repair precondition failures by adding proof blocks
- **repair_remove_inv**: Remove redundant self.inv() calls when type_invariant is used
- **repair_postcond**: Repair postcondition failures by adding proofs or modifying invariants
- **repair_invariant**: Repair invariant failures by adding proofs or loop assertions
- **repair_arithmetic**: Repair arithmetic failures including overflow/underflow and nonlinear proofs
- **repair_type**: Repair type-related errors including mismatched types and annotations
- **repair_decrease**: Repair decreases failures in loops and recursive functions
- **repair_missing**: Repair missing imports, implementations, and other elements
- **repair_mode**: Repair mode-related errors like exec/proof/spec mode mismatches
- **repair_old_self**: Fixes requires clauses to use old(self) for &mut variables


## Verification Workflows

### Core Workflows
There are exactly four possible verification sequences:

1. **Full Sequence Workflow**
   ```
   view_inference → view_refinement → [inv_inference] → spec_inference
   ```
   Used when the code needs a complete verification solution including View functions.
   Note: inv_inference step is conditional - only include if input is a class/struct data structure.

2. **Invariant-First Workflow**
   ```
   inv_inference → spec_inference
   ```
   Used when type invariants are needed but View functions are not required.
   Note: Only applicable for class/struct data structures.

3. **Specification-Only Workflow**
   ```
   spec_inference
   ```
   Used when only function specifications are needed.
   This is the default workflow for non-class/struct inputs.

4. **Invariant-Only Workflow**
   ```
   inv_inference
   ```
   Used when only type invariants are needed and no function specifications are required.
   Note: Only applicable for class/struct data structures.

### Optional Final Step
- If "TODO: add proof" or "TODO: add invariants" exists in the code, append `proof_generation` as the final step
- This applies to all workflows

### Workflow Selection Criteria

**Choose Invariant-Only Workflow if ALL of these are true:**
- Code contains class/struct data structures needing type invariants
- No "TODO: add requires/ensures" or specification-related placeholders present
- No explicit "View" implementation requirements
- No View-related TODOs present in the code

**Choose Specification-Only Workflow if ALL of these are true:**
- No explicit "View" implementation requirements in the code
- No class/struct data structures requiring type invariants
- Placeholders only request "add requires/ensures" or "add specification"
- No View-related or invariant-related TODO/placeholder markers present

**Choose Invariant-First Workflow if:**
- Code contains class/struct data structures needing type invariants
- Has "TODO: add requires/ensures" or specification-related placeholders
- No explicit "View" implementation requirements
- No "View" keyword or View-related TODOs present in the code
- Note: Skip this workflow if input is not a class/struct data structure

**Choose Full Sequence Workflow if and ONLY if:**
- Code explicitly contains "View" keyword or requires View implementation
- Contains phrases like "implement View" or "TODO: add View"
- View functions are explicitly mentioned in type definitions or specifications
- Note: Skip inv_inference step if input is not a class/struct data structure

## Analysis Requirements


### Dependencies
- Note relationships between:
  - Data structures and their View functions
  - Functions and their specifications
  - Proofs and their dependencies

## Output Format

### 1. Analysis Summary
```markdown
Current State:
- [Key findings about current verification state]
- [Identified missing components]
- [Critical verification challenges]

Dependencies:
- [Important component relationships]
- [Verification dependencies]
```

### 2. Verification Plan
```markdown
**Selected Workflow:** [Full Sequence Workflow | Specification-Only Workflow]

**Justification:**
[2-3 sentences explaining workflow choice based on criteria]
[For workflows with inv_inference: explain why input qualifies as class/struct data structure]

**Execution Steps:**
1. [First module]
2. [Next module]
...
[Include proof_generation if "TODO: add proof" or "TODO: add invariants" or "TODO: add invariant" exists]

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: [Yes/No - explain if input is class/struct data structure]
- proof_generation: [Yes/No - list any TODO markers found]
```

## Important Notes
- Follow workflow patterns EXACTLY as specified
- Do not modify or suggest modifications to existing code
- Focus on verification strategy, not implementation details


## Query
# Verus Specification Code Synthesis Task

This file describes a verus Specification Code Synthesis task, which consists of the following four separate parts.

1. **Verus Code:** The verus code that is not fully verified.
2. **Compilation Error:** The compiler error reported from the verus code above.
3. **Knowledge**: The knowledge of the components mentioned in the code.
4. **Failures:**: The previous failures that the LLM should avoid to do again, each failure consists of:
   - the verus code and,
   - the compilation error.

## Verus Code

use vstd::prelude::*;
use vstd::seq_lib::group_seq_properties;

verus! {

struct VecSet {
    vt: Vec<u64>,
}

impl VecSet {
    pub closed spec fn view(&self) -> Set<u64> {
        // TODO: add requires and ensures
    }

    pub fn new() -> (s: Self)
        // TODO: add requires and ensures
    {
        VecSet { vt: Vec::new() }
    }

    pub fn insert(&mut self, v: u64)
        // TODO: add requires and ensures
    {
        // TODO: add proof
        self.vt.push(v);
    }

    pub fn contains(&self, v: u64) -> (contained: bool)
        // TODO: add requires and ensures
    {
        for i in iter: 0..self.vt.len()
        // TODO: add invariant
        {
            if self.vt[i] == v {
                return true;
            }
        }
        false
    }
}

/* TSET CODE BELOW */

fn test(t: Vec<u64>)
{
    let mut vs: VecSet = VecSet::new();
    assert(vs@ =~= set![]);
    vs.insert(3);
    vs.insert(5);
    let contains2 = vs.contains(2);
    assert(!contains2);
    let contains3 = vs.contains(3);
    assert(contains3);
    assert(vs@ =~= set![3, 5]);
}

pub fn main() {}

} // verus!
