## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines three functions (binary_search, reverse, binary_search_no_spinoff) that each have "TODO: add specification" markers and loop bodies requiring "TODO: add invariants."
- No data structures (structs/classes) are declared, so no type invariants are needed.
- No "View" functions or references are present, ruling out view_inference or view_refinement steps.

Dependencies:
- Each function depends on correct loop invariants to maintain internal consistency.
- The eventual correctness proofs hinge on adding the required preconditions, postconditions, and loop invariants, along with subsequent proof obligations.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
- The code contains only functions with specification-related TODOs, and there are no struct/class data structures requiring type invariants.
- There is no mention of or requirement for View functions.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference
2. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No – there is no class/struct data structure, so no type invariants are required.
- proof_generation: Yes – "TODO: add invariants" appears in the code, which triggers proof generation.
