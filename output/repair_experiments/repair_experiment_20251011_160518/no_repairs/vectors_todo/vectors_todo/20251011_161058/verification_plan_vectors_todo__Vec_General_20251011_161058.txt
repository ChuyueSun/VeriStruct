## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code consists of functions (binary_search, reverse, binary_search_no_spinoff) operating on standard library vectors (Vec<u64>) rather than a custom data structure.
- Multiple "TODO: add specification" markers are present, indicating missing requires/ensures clauses for these functions.
- There are "TODO: add invariants" markers specifically for loop invariants, not for any type/class invariants.
- No references to a "View" or custom data structure requiring a View function.

Dependencies:
- The primary verification need is to supply function specifications (requires/ensures) and loop invariants.
- The covered functions do not depend on additional or custom type invariants, as there is no custom struct/class.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
- The code does not define a custom data structure (class/struct) requiring type invariants.
- The placeholders explicitly request adding function specifications ("TODO: add specification").
- There is no mention of or requirement for a View function.
- Although there are “TODO: add invariants” markers, they refer to loop invariants rather than type invariants, so “inv_inference” for a data structure is not required.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference
2. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No (the code does not define a class/struct needing data structure invariants)
- proof_generation: Yes (“TODO: add invariants” markers are present, indicating the need for proof blocks)
```
