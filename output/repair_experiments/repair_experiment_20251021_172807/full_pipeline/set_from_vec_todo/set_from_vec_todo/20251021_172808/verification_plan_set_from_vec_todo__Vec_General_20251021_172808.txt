Current State:
- The code defines a struct (VecSet) that has a “view” function, but the view is incomplete.
- There are multiple “TODO” markers: “add requires and ensures”, “add proof”, and “add invariant”.
- A for-loop suggests we may need type invariants or loop invariants.
- The presence of an explicit “view” function indicates a need for a full View-based verification approach.

Dependencies:
- The VecSet struct depends on its view function to model the mathematical set abstraction.
- The methods new, insert, and contains all depend on adequate specifications (requires/ensures).
- The “TODO: add proof” indicates proof blocks will rely on the data structure’s correctness and specification details.

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
The code explicitly includes a “view” function for the VecSet type (“pub closed spec fn view”), which requires us to perform view inference and refinement. Additionally, the code is a struct data structure with invariants and specification placeholders, so inv_inference and spec_inference are also necessary. Because there is a “TODO: add proof” marker, proof_generation will be appended as well.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – the code defines a struct (VecSet) and includes a “TODO: add invariant” comment.
- proof_generation: Yes – there is a “TODO: add proof” marker.
