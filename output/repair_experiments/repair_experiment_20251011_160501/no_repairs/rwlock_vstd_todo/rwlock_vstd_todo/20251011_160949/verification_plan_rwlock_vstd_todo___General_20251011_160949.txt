Current State:
- A struct "FixedParity" implements RwLockPredicate<u64> but its inv() function is missing a specification (marked by “TODO: add specification”).
- There is a struct data definition (FixedParity) plus a specification placeholder.
- No explicit request to implement a custom “View” function; the “view” methods shown are internal helper specs for read handles, not a new data-structure View function requirement.

Dependencies:
- The FixedParity.inv() function depends on a specification describing permissible values based on parity.
- RwLock usage in test() depends on the correctness of FixedParity.inv().

```

**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
This code has a struct ("FixedParity") and a specification placeholder ("TODO: add specification") for its inv() function. There is no explicit mention of needing or refining a “View” function, so the Full Sequence Workflow does not apply. Because we do have a data structure plus a spec placeholder, Invariant-First Workflow is appropriate.

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – the code includes a struct (FixedParity) needing an internal invariant or type-based condition.
- proof_generation: No – there is no "TODO: add proof" or "TODO: add invariants" marker present.
