Current State:
- The code includes several functions (is_Some, is_None, get_Some_0, Or, and so on) with TODO comments to add specifications (requires/ensures clauses).
- No references to “View” functions or a need for type invariants specific to struct/class data structures.
- No “TODO: add invariants” or “TODO: add proof” placeholders.

Dependencies:
- The MyOption enum’s functions depend on properly specified behaviors to ensure correctness.
- No additional proof or invariant dependencies beyond basic function specifications.

```

```markdown
**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
This code does not require any View-related functionality and does not include a struct/class needing invariants. The only placeholders are for function specifications (requires/ensures), making the Specification-Only Workflow most appropriate.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No – The input is an enum, not a class/struct requiring invariants.
- proof_generation: No – No “TODO: add proof” or “TODO: add invariants” found.
```
