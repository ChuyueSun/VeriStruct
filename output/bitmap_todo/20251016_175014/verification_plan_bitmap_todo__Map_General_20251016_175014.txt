Current State:
- The code defines a BitMap struct with a “view” function placeholder and incomplete function specifications.
- The “view” function is explicitly mentioned and needs an implementation.
- There are also TODOs to add requires/ensures and proofs in various methods.
- Therefore, both a View and function specs/proofs are needed.

Dependencies:
- The BitMap struct and its “view” function depend on each other for correctness.
- Functions (from, get_bit, set_bit, or) depend on the final specification and invariants.
- Proofs will depend on the finalized view definition, invariants, and specs.

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
The code explicitly includes a “view” function (“spec fn view(&self)”) and a TODO to implement it. Additionally, there are class/struct data structures (BitMap) and TODOs to add function specs and proofs. This fits the Full Sequence Workflow criteria. Since BitMap is a struct, we include the inv_inference step.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – because BitMap is a struct requiring type invariants
- proof_generation: Yes – there is a “TODO: add proof” in the set_bit function
```
