## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The struct "FixedParity" is present but lacks a complete specification for its RwLockPredicate::inv method ("TODO: add specification").
- The code otherwise compiles but is missing a formal spec in the place of that TODO.
- There is no request for implementing or refining a View function, and no existing "TODO: add proof" or "TODO: add invariants."

Dependencies:
- The "FixedParity" struct is used within RwLock as its predicate.
- Completing the specification for FixedParity is necessary so that the lock invariant (RwLockPredicate::inv) can be properly enforced.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
- The code contains a struct data structure ("FixedParity").
- There is a "TODO: add specification" placeholder, signalling a need for function specifications.
- No View-related feature or "TODO" is requested, so a full View-based workflow is unnecessary.

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes, because "FixedParity" is a struct data structure.
- proof_generation: No, there is no "TODO: add proof" or "TODO: add invariants" present.
```
