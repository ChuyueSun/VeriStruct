It depends on what properties or behaviors you need to verify. Examples include:

• If you want to prove certain conditions hold before or after the function runs (e.g., the function never returns a value smaller than both inputs), you can add “requires” and “ensures” clauses asserting those conditions.
• If you want an invariant that applies to a data structure or module overall (for example, a linked list’s shape or correctness properties), you can add a spec function labeled with #[verifier::type_invariant] or something equivalent, and then strengthen the code to maintain that invariant.

Let me know what you’d like to prove or what attributes you’d like to guarantee, and I can show you how to introduce the appropriate spec/invariant and requires/ensures clauses.
