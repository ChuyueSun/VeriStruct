## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a BST-based TreeMap data structure with insert/delete/get operations.
- It includes a View implementation for TreeMap, but the view function is incomplete ("TODO: add specification").
- There are "TODO: add specification" placeholders in several functions, including TreeMap::as_map and Node methods.
- There is an explicit "TODO: add proof" comment in TreeMap::insert, indicating a proof is required.
- The data structures have a type invariant (well_formed) but parts of the specification suite are not implemented.

Dependencies:
- TreeMap → Node → well_formed property for BST invariants.
- View trait implementation requires a valid view that matches the Map representation.
- The "TODO: add proof" in TreeMap::insert depends on the well_formed invariants to prove correctness of insertion.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
This code explicitly contains a “View” trait implementation ("impl<V> View for TreeMap<V>") requiring a valid view function. It also includes data structures (Node, TreeMap) that have invariants, and there are multiple “TODO: add specification” placeholders indicating we need full spec inference. Since there is a struct with a type invariant and an unfinished View function, the Full Sequence Workflow is mandated.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – the code defines a struct TreeMap (and Node) and needs type invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes – due to the "TODO: add proof" comment in TreeMap::insert.
```
