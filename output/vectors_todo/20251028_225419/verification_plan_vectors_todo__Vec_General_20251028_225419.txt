## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines free-standing functions (binary_search, reverse, binary_search_no_spinoff) with "TODO: add specification" placeholders.
- There is no class or struct data structure present.
- There are also "TODO: add invariants" placeholders (for loops), but these refer to loop invariants, not type invariants.
- No mention of "View" or related keywords.

Identified Missing Components:
- Formal requires/ensures specifications for the functions.
- Loop invariants to ensure the correctness of while/for loops.

Critical Verification Challenges:
- Ensuring that the missing specifications accurately capture preconditions/postconditions.
- Adding loop invariants that maintain correct behavior throughout the iterations.

Dependencies:
- The three functions (binary_search, reverse, binary_search_no_spinoff) each need appropriate specifications.
- Loop invariants in these functions depend on the tasks performed inside the loops.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
- No class/struct data structure requiring type invariants is present.
- There are "TODO: add specification" placeholders indicating a need for function specifications.
- No "View" implementation or "View" keyword usage is found.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference
2. proof_generation  (added because "TODO: add invariants" triggers the optional final proof step)

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No (no class/struct data structure is present)
- proof_generation: Yes (due to the "TODO: add invariants" markers in the code)
