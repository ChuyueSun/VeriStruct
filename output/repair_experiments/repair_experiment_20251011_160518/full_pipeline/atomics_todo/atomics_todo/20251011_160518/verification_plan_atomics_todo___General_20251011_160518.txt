Current State:
- The code defines a struct (Lock<T>) with an invariant placeholder ("TODO: add specification" in well_formed).
- The function take<T> also has placeholders for function specification ("TODO: add requires and ensures") and loop invariants ("TODO: add invariants").
- There is no mention of or requirement for a View implementation.
- The presence of placeholders indicates both type invariants and function specifications must be added.

Dependencies:
- The Lock<T> data structure’s invariant depends on properly specifying its well_formed function.
- The take<T> function’s correctness depends on its requires/ensures clauses and loop invariants.
- No additional “View” relationships are required.

**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
We have a struct requiring invariants and also specification placeholders ("TODO: add requires and ensures"). There is no mention of "View" or a View function. Therefore, we apply the Invariant-First Workflow which is inv_inference → spec_inference. Since "TODO: add invariants" appears, we finish with proof_generation.

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference
3. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes - the Lock<T> struct mandates type invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes - "TODO: add invariants" is present, requiring proof details.
