Current State:
- The enum MyOption<A> has multiple "TODO: add specification" markers for various spec functions and methods but no mention of any type invariants or View functions.
- There is no "TODO: add invariants" or "TODO: add View" directive.

Dependencies:
- Each function (is_Some, is_None, get_Some_0, Or, or, is_some, is_none, as_ref, unwrap) depends on proper specification (requires/ensures).
- No data-structure invariants or View-based abstractions are referenced.

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
There are no View-related requirements and no indication of a need for type invariants. The code only contains "TODO: add specification" or "TODO: add requires/ensures," which fits the Specification-Only Workflow criteria.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No – the code does not indicate a need for type invariants
- proof_generation: No – there is no "TODO: add proof" or "TODO: add invariants"
