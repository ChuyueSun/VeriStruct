## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a simple struct "Account" and a function "transfer" with a "TODO: add requires and ensures" placeholder.
- No invariants or "View" functions are requested or mentioned in the code.
- There is no indication that a type invariant is needed for the "Account" struct.

Dependencies:
- The function "transfer" depends on properly defining its specifications (requires/ensures).
- The test function checks the result of the transfer using assertions but raises no additional verification needs related to invariants or views.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
- The code does not require or request any type invariants on the struct "Account."
- There is no mention of "View" or "TODO: add View," so a view-based workflow is unnecessary.
- The only placeholder is "TODO: add requires and ensures," indicating specification needs without invariants.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No – no indication or request for a type invariant.
- proof_generation: No – no "TODO: add proof" or "TODO: add invariants" statements present.
```
