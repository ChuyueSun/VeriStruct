Current State:
- The code defines a data-structure-like “Lock<T>” macro-invoked with “struct_with_invariants!”
- The Lock<T> struct has a “TODO: add specification” placeholder and the “take” function has “TODO: add requires/ensures”
- There is also a “TODO: add invariants” in the loop within “take”
- No mention of “View” or “implement View” exists, so no explicit View function requirement
- Overall, the code needs both type invariants and function specifications

Dependencies:
- The Lock<T> data structure’s invariants depend on the well_formed function
- The take function requires the lock’s type invariants to hold, plus additional function specs
- Proof work will depend on both the newly inferred invariants and the derived requires/ensures

```

**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
This workflow is chosen because there is a class/struct data structure (Lock<T>) needing type invariants, and the code includes placeholders requesting function specifications (“TODO: add requires/ensures”). There are no explicit “View” requirements, so the Full Sequence Workflow is not triggered.

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference
3. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes - there is a Lock<T> data structure declared via struct_with_invariants!
- proof_generation: Yes - “TODO: add invariants” is present
```
