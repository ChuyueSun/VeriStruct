# Prompt

## System
You are a helpful AI assistant specialized in Verus formal verification.

## Instruction

You are a highly experienced expert in Verus (the verifier for Rust). Your task is to refine the "View" function within the given Verus file. The "View" function is the mathematical abstraction for a data structure, capturing the minimal information needed for its specification in Verus.

It is perfectly acceptable to leave the code unchanged if the current abstraction is already appropriate; modify the "View" function only when necessary.

**CRITICAL: DO NOT "refine" sequential/indexed data into sets!**
  - If the current view is `Seq<T>` (e.g., `Seq<bool>` for bitmaps), **KEEP IT AS Seq<T>**
  - DO NOT change `Seq<bool>` to `(nat, Set<nat>)` - this makes verification extremely difficult
  - Sequential data structures (bitmaps, arrays, buffers) REQUIRE Seq for indexed access and update operations
  - **"More succinct" does NOT mean "better for verification"**

Your responsibilities:
  1. Analyze the current "View" function to determine if its tuple (or other structure) adequately represents the module.
  2. Evaluate whether the abstraction can be improved. (Hint: If the tuple is identical to the internal fields, that is likely not an ideal abstraction.)
  3. **EXCEPTION**: If the current view is `Seq<T>` for indexed/sequential data (bitmaps, arrays, vectors), DO NOT change it - `Seq<T>` is the correct abstraction!
  4. Modify only the "View" function to improve its abstraction while leaving all other parts of the file unchanged.
  5. Any refined view must convey at least the same amount of information. For non-sequential data, aim to use a flattened tuple that is shorter than the original.
  6. **IMPORTANT**: Do not remove any "// TODO" markers in the code. Preserve all TODO comments exactly as they appear.
  7. Return the **entire updated Verus file** with your refined "View" function (or the original file if no changes were necessary) and nothing else changed.

**Common patterns to PRESERVE (do not change these)**:
  - `Seq<bool>` for bitmaps → Keep as `Seq<bool>`
  - `Seq<T>` for Vec<T> or Array<T> → Keep as `Seq<T>`
  - `Seq<T>` for ring buffers, queues → Keep as `Seq<T>`

**Common patterns that CAN be refined**:
  - Tuple of raw fields → Abstract mathematical properties
  - Redundant information → Remove duplicates
  - Complex nested tuples → Flatten when possible

Please provide only the complete Rust code of the file with no additional commentary.


# Verus Common Knowledge

## Important Notes
- ALWAYS use parentheses whenever possible for clarity!
- Don't delete existing non-buggy `#[trigger]`!
- Don't change "unwind" to `(unwind) as bool`!
- Return the complete modified Rust code in your response without explanations.
- Keep top level docstrings at the top of the file, before `verus! {`. Do not place them after the `verus! {` declaration.
- Don't change any function signatures.

## Spec Functions
1. No Direct Method Calls:
   In a spec function, you cannot directly call instance methods such as vector.is_full().
2. Use the @ Operator:
   To invoke methods on a variable within a spec, first convert it to its specification-level representation View with @.
3. Always use vector.len() instead of vector@.len().
4. Simplify Boolean Conjunctions:
   When combining multiple conditions, avoid excessive &&&. Fewer (or well-structured) conjunctions make the spec code easier to read and debug.
5. Parentheses Usage:
   ALWAYS wrap conditions in parentheses, even for simple expressions. This makes precedence explicit and prevents errors.

## Proof Blocks - CRITICAL SYNTAX RULES

**🚫 NEVER use executable control flow (if/else/match) inside `proof { }` blocks!**

Proof blocks are spec-level contexts. They can only contain:
- `assert(...)` statements
- `assume(...)` statements
- Lemma/proof function calls
- Variable bindings with spec expressions

❌ **WRONG - Executable if/else in proof:**
```rust
proof {
    if condition { assert(x); } else { assert(y); }  // SYNTAX ERROR!
}
```

✅ **CORRECT - Use implication instead:**
```rust
proof {
    assert(condition ==> x);
    assert(!condition ==> y);
}
```

❌ **WRONG - Executable match in proof:**
```rust
proof {
    match opt { Some(v) => assert(v > 0), None => {} }  // SYNTAX ERROR!
}
```

✅ **CORRECT - Use implication or spec-level reasoning:**
```rust
proof {
    assert(opt.is_Some() ==> opt.unwrap() > 0);
}
```

## Operators
Verus extends Rust logical operators with low-precedence forms that are especially helpful in specification code:

Standard Operators: &&, ||, ==>, <==>
Low-Precedence Variants: &&& and |||

The meaning of &&& is the same as && (logical AND), and ||| is the same as || (logical OR), but with lower precedence. This allows you to write conditions in a "bulleted list" style that remains grouped in a logical manner:

```
&&& a ==> b
&&& c
&&& d <==> e && f
```

is equivalent to:

```
(a ==> b) && c && (d <==> (e && f))
```

Note:
- Implication (==>) and equivalence (<==>) bind more tightly than &&& and |||.
- Using &&&/||| can make long specifications clearer by grouping logical clauses neatly.


# Verus View Function Guidelines

## 🚨 CRITICAL RULE: Check Tuple Size vs Field Count

**If the struct has N fields and the View type is an N-tuple, the view is TRIVIAL and MUST be refined!**

Examples:
  - ❌ TRIVIAL: `struct {ring, head, tail}` → `type V = (Seq<T>, nat, nat)` (3 fields, 3-tuple = NO abstraction)
  - ✅ GOOD: `struct {ring, head, tail}` → `type V = (Seq<T>, nat)` (3 fields, 2-tuple = ABSTRACTION!)
  - ✅ GOOD: `struct {data, len}` → `type V = Seq<T>` (2 fields, single type = ABSTRACTION!)

**Rule:** Tuple size MUST be STRICTLY LESS than field count to show true abstraction!

## View Refinement Guidelines
1. A good View abstraction should:
   - Represent the essential state of the data structure, not just copy its fields
   - Hide implementation details while preserving behavior
   - Be as simple as possible while being complete
   - **Have fewer elements in the tuple than fields in the struct** (or use a single non-tuple type)

2. Common refinements:
   - For collections (arrays, lists): Use Seq<T> instead of raw arrays
   - For indices: Use meaningful representations (e.g., range of valid elements)
   - For flag fields: Consider if they can be derived from other state
   - **Combine related fields into semantic abstractions** (e.g., ring+head+tail → active_elements)

3. Avoid redundancy:
   - Only include fields necessary for specification
   - Derive computable properties in method ensures clauses, not in the view
   - **Don't just wrap every field in a tuple - that's not abstraction!**

4. Prefer mathematical types over concrete types when possible


# Verus Match Syntax Guidelines

## Using `matches!` Macro

In Verus, the `matches!` macro must use Rust's standard macro syntax:

```rust
// CORRECT
pub open spec fn is_Some<A>(opt: MyOption<A>) -> bool {
    matches!(opt, MyOption::Some(_))
}

// INCORRECT - don't use this syntax
pub open spec fn is_Some<A>(opt: MyOption<A>) -> bool {
    matches opt {
        MyOption::Some(_) => true,
        MyOption::None => false,
    }
}
```

## Match with `arbitrary()` in Spec Functions

When writing spec functions that match on patterns with impossible/unreachable branches, use `arbitrary()` instead of `unreachable!()`:

```rust
// CORRECT
pub open spec fn get_Some_0<A>(opt: MyOption<A>) -> A
    recommends is_Some(opt)
{
    match opt {
        MyOption::Some(a) => a,
        MyOption::None => arbitrary(), // For unreachable branches in spec functions
    }
}

// INCORRECT
pub open spec fn get_Some_0<A>(opt: MyOption<A>) -> A
    recommends is_Some(opt)
{
    match opt {
        MyOption::Some(a) => a,
        MyOption::None => unreachable!(), // Don't use this in spec functions
    }
}
```

## Match in Executable Functions

For unreachable branches in executable functions, use `unreached()`:

```rust
pub fn unwrap(self) -> (a: A)
    requires
        is_Some(self),
    ensures
        a == get_Some_0(self),
{
    match self {
        MyOption::Some(a) => a,
        MyOption::None => unreached(), // For unreachable branches in exec functions
    }
}
```

## Match in Proof Functions

For unreachable branches in proof functions, use `proof_from_false()`:

```rust
pub proof fn tracked_unwrap(tracked self) -> (tracked a: A)
    requires
        is_Some(self),
    ensures
        a == get_Some_0(self),
{
    match self {
        MyOption::Some(a) => a,
        MyOption::None => proof_from_false(), // For unreachable branches in proof functions
    }
}
```


# Verus Sequence Knowledge

Seq<T> is a mathematical sequence type used in specifications:

- Building: Seq::empty(), seq![x, y, z], Seq::singleton(x)
- Length: s.len()
- Indexing: s[i] (0-based)
- Subrange: s.subrange(lo, hi) gives elements from index lo (inclusive) to hi (exclusive)
- Concatenation: s1 + s2
- Update: s.update(i, v) returns a new sequence with index i updated to value v
- Contains: s.contains(v) checks if v is in the sequence
- Push/pop: s.push(v), s.pop() (returns new sequence, doesn't modify original)
- Equality: Use `=~=` for sequence equality, NOT `==` (e.g., `seq1 =~= seq2`, `self@.0 =~= old(self)@.0.subrange(1, (old(self)@.0.len()) as int)`)

You can use forall or exists for properties over sequences.

## CRITICAL: Postconditions for Seq<T> Update Operations

**For functions that update a single element in a sequence-based view**:

**✅ PREFER** - Use `.update()` for succinct, provable specifications:
```rust
fn update_element(&mut self, idx: usize, value: T)
    requires
        idx < old(self)@.len(),
    ensures
        self@ == old(self)@.update(idx as int, value),  // ✅ Succinct!
```

**❌ AVOID** - Verbose element-wise specifications (makes proofs much harder):
```rust
ensures
    self@.len() == old(self)@.len(),
    forall|i: int| 0 <= i && i < self@.len() && i != idx as int ==> self@[i] == old(self)@[i],
    self@[idx as int] == value,
```

**Why `.update()` is better**:
1. More concise and readable
2. Directly matches proof patterns (pairs with `assert_seqs_equal!`)
3. Easier for Verus SMT solver to reason about
4. Standard pattern in Verus for sequence modifications

**When to use this pattern**:
- Any function that modifies exactly one position in a Seq-based view
- After operations that update a single element (e.g., `self.data.set(index, value)`)
- Functions with postconditions about changing one element while preserving others

## Subrange Usage

1. Cast indices to `int`: `self.head as int`, not just `self.head`
2. Use `.subrange(start, end)`, not `seq[start..end]`
3. Wrap complex expressions: `(..).subrange((expression) as int, ...)`
4. For full length: `(sequence.len()) as int`

## verification_plan

## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a RingBuffer<T> struct and explicitly implements "impl<T: Copy> View for RingBuffer<T>" with a placeholder comment "TODO: add specification".
- Each method in RingBuffer (e.g., len, has_elements, is_full, new, enqueue, dequeue, available_len) has "TODO: add requires and ensures" and "TODO: add proof" markers.
- The ring buffer has a type invariant annotation ("#[verifier::type_invariant]") that is unfinished.

Identified Missing Components:
- A proper View function for RingBuffer<T>.
- Invariants for the ring buffer data structure.
- Requires/ensures clauses (function specifications) for each method.
- Proofs addressing the "TODO: add proof" markers.

Critical Verification Challenges:
- Constructing a correct mathematical View for RingBuffer.
- Inferring and verifying all required invariants and specifications.
- Ensuring each method’s requires/ensures clauses align with the ring buffer's type invariant and View.

Dependencies:
- The ring buffer’s View depends on how the fields (head, tail, ring) are modeled mathematically.
- Each method’s specification depends on the type invariant and the ring buffer’s View.
- The ring buffer’s proofs require established invariants and specifications to demonstrate correctness.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
The code explicitly contains “impl<T: Copy> View for RingBuffer<T>” and “TODO: add specification” for that View implementation. We also have a struct data structure (RingBuffer) with a type_invariant, so inv_inference is relevant. Since the code needs both View and invariant specification, we use the full sequence workflow.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes — RingBuffer is a struct with a “#[verifier::type_invariant]” marker.
- proof_generation: Yes — The code includes “TODO: add proof” markers.
