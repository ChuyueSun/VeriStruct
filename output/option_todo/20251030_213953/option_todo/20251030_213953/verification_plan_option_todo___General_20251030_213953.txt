### 1. Analysis Summary
```markdown
Current State:
- The code defines an algebraic data type (an enum, MyOption) with several open spec functions (is_Some, is_None, get_Some_0) and other methods that have placeholders for requires/ensures clauses.
- There are multiple "TODO: add specification" and "TODO: add requires and ensures" markers, indicating that function specifications are incomplete.
- There is no explicit requirement for View functions or type invariants for class/struct data structures; MyOption is an enum, not a struct.

Dependencies:
- The correctness of the non-spec functions (e.g., or, is_some, is_none, as_ref, unwrap) relies on accurate specification inferred by the spec_inference module.
- The open spec functions depend on the provided TODO placeholders to be filled in with proper logical conditions.
```

### 2. Verification Plan
```markdown
**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
The input does not contain any explicit "View" implementation requirements nor does it include class/struct data structures that require type invariants. Instead, the primary missing components are the function specifications—as indicated by "TODO: add specification" and "TODO: add requires and ensures" comments. Therefore, the Specification-Only Workflow is best suited for inferring the required preconditions and postconditions.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No – the input is an enum, not a class/struct that would normally require invariants.
- proof_generation: No – there are no "TODO: add proof" markers in the code.
```
