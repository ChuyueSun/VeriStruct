Current State:
- The code defines a struct BitMap and includes "TODO: implement view" indicating a custom View function is needed.
- Multiple methods contain "TODO: add requires and ensures" placeholders, indicating missing specifications.
- There are "TODO: add proof" placeholders requiring explicit proof blocks.
- Overall, the code requires the creation of a View function, potential invariants for the struct, the specification clauses for methods, and the final proofs.

Dependencies:
- The struct BitMap’s mathematical abstraction depends on a correct implementation of the view() function.
- The methods set_bit, get_bit, or all rely on correct specifications and potentially require invariants on BitMap.
- Proof generation depends on the newly introduced specification and invariants.

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
This code explicitly requires a View implementation ("TODO: implement view") and is a struct data structure. It also needs function specifications. Therefore, the Full Sequence Workflow is required. Because it is a struct, we include the inv_inference step. Additionally, there are "TODO: add proof" markers, so proof_generation is appended.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – the BitMap struct qualifies as a data structure requiring possible invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes – there are "TODO: add proof" items requiring explicit proofs.
```
