```markdown
Current State:
- Several function placeholders (is_Some, is_None, get_Some_0, Or, or, is_some, is_none, as_ref, unwrap) with "TODO: add specification" or "TODO: add requires and ensures"
- No invariant-related requests or data-invariant mentions
- No View-requested implementation or View-related TODOs

Dependencies:
- The MyOption enum is referenced in multiple function signatures
- The test function exercises all these methods, showing they need proper specifications

```

```markdown
**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
The code has placeholders strictly requesting function specifications ("TODO: add specification", "TODO: add requires/ensures") with no mention of data invariants or View functions. There is a user-defined enum, but there are no "TODO: add invariants" or class/struct invariants required, and no View references.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No - the code does not request data invariants for MyOption.
- proof_generation: No - there are no "TODO: add proof" references in the code.
```
