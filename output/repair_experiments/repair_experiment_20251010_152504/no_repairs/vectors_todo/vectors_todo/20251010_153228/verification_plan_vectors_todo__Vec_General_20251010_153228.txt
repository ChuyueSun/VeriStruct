## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- Multiple functions (binary_search, reverse, binary_search_no_spinoff) have "TODO: add specification" placeholders.
- There are also "TODO: add invariants" placeholders in loop bodies, indicating the need for loop proofs or invariants.
- No user-defined struct or class data structure is present; only standard library Vec is used.

Dependencies:
- The primary verification need is to add appropriate requires/ensures specs and loop invariants for these functions.
- Proof obligations arise from fulfilling these specification and invariant requirements.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
- No custom data structure means inv_inference is not needed.
- No mention of "View" or view-related TODOs disqualifies the Full Sequence Workflow.
- The code specifically requires function specs ("TODO: add specification"), making the Specification-Only Workflow appropriate.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference
2. proof_generation (added because "TODO: add invariants" appears in the code)

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No (no custom class/struct data structure)
- proof_generation: Yes (due to "TODO: add invariants" markers)
```
