## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The functions "binary_search", "reverse", and "binary_search_no_spinoff" all have "TODO: add specification" placeholders (i.e., missing requires/ensures clauses).
- Each also has "TODO: add invariants" for the loops, indicating the need for loop invariants but no user-defined struct/class requires type invariants.
- There is no mention of or requirement for View functions (no "View" keyword or "implement View").

Dependencies:
- The test functions "binary_search_test" and "reverse_test" depend on correct specifications and loop invariants in the original functions to prove assertions.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
- The code lacks any user-defined class/struct data type, so there is no need for type invariant inference.
- The "TODO" markers specifically indicate missing specifications ("add specification") and loop invariants, but not a View or type invariants.
- Therefore, only spec_inference is required, plus proof_generation because "TODO: add invariants" is present.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference
2. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No (no user-defined class/struct requires a type invariant)
- proof_generation: Yes (because "TODO: add invariants" is present)
```
