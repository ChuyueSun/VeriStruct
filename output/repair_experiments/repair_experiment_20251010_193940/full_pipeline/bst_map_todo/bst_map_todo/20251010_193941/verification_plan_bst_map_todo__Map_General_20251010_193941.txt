## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code includes two data structures, Node and TreeMap, and both require well-formedness invariants.
- There is an implementation of the View trait for TreeMap which explicitly requires a view function.
- Several functions also have “TODO: add specification” and “TODO: add requires and ensures.”
- The insert function contains a “TODO: add proof” marker.

Identified Missing Components:
- View function improvements (since the code must implement the View trait).
- Type invariants and well-formedness conditions are present but may require refinement.
- Requires/ensures specifications for various methods are missing.
- Proof obligations (e.g., “TODO: add proof”) are unfinished.

Critical Verification Challenges:
- Ensuring that the BST properties hold during insertion and deletion.
- Properly specifying the behavior of each function with requires/ensures clauses.
- Providing a correct View implementation for the entire TreeMap.

Dependencies:
- The TreeMap’s as_map function depends on the underlying Node as_map and optional_as_map functions.
- The well_formed property of TreeMap depends on Node’s well_formed.
- The insertion and deletion operations depend on the BST invariants held by Node and TreeMap.
- The specification for the View trait relies on TreeMap’s as_map representation.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
- The code explicitly contains an implementation of the “View” trait, indicating a need for view-related inference.
- Structs Node and TreeMap require invariants, so inv_inference is applicable.
- Multiple “TODO: add specification” comments call for spec_inference.
- There is a “TODO: add proof” comment that necessitates proof_generation as a final step.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes (the input contains class/struct data structures, Node and TreeMap, needing invariants).
- proof_generation: Yes (“TODO: add proof” exists in the insert function).
