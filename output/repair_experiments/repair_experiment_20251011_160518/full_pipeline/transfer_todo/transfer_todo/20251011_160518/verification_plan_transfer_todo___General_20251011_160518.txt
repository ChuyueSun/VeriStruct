```markdown
Current State:
- The code defines a struct Account with a single field balance and a transfer function.
- A TODO comment indicates the need to add requires/ensures specifications to the transfer function.
- There is no mention of needing type invariants or any View-related functionality.

Dependencies:
- The transfer function depends on valid input parameters (amount, orig, dest).
- No invariants or View definitions are required by the code.

```

```markdown
**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
There is a struct (Account), but no indication that type invariants are needed. The code explicitly requests adding function specifications ("TODO: add requires and ensures") without referencing View or invariants. Therefore, only function specifications are required.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No – the code does not require type invariants.
- proof_generation: No – there is no "TODO: add proof" or "TODO: add invariants" present.
```
