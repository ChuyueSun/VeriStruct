## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a struct "Account" with a single field "balance: u64".
- There is a "TODO: add requires and ensures" comment in the "transfer" function, indicating a need for function specification.
- No "View" functionality or invariants are requested or mentioned.
- There is no "TODO: add proof" or "TODO: add invariants" comment.

Dependencies:
- The "transfer" function's correctness depends on ensuring valid inputs (e.g., preventing underflow and overflow) and establishing the correct postcondition for the balances.
- The "test" function calls "transfer" and checks for correct behavior but does not require explicit invariants on the Account struct.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
- The code has a struct "Account" but does not explicitly require an invariant for it.
- There is a clear "TODO: add requires and ensures" prompt, requesting function specifications for "transfer."
- No View-related features or TODOs are present, and no invariants have been requested.
- Therefore, only function specifications are needed.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No – the code does not indicate or require type invariants.
- proof_generation: No – there is no "TODO: add proof" or "TODO: add invariants" comment.
