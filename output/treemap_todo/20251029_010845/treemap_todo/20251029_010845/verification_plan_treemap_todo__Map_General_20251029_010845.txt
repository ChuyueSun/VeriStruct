## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The TreeMap and Node structs are partially specified but contain TODO markers for specifications and proofs.
- The code already implements the View trait for TreeMap but does not fully provide specifications (missing requires/ensures).
- There are TODO markers such as "TODO: add specification" and "TODO: add proof" indicating missing specification clauses and proofs.

Dependencies:
- The TreeMap data structure depends on Node for its BST implementation and thus depends on Node's invariants and map representation.
- The code’s BST properties (invariants in Node) must remain consistent with the TreeMap’s type invariant.
- The “view” implementation for TreeMap relies on Node’s optional_as_map to produce a Map<u64, V> view.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
The code explicitly contains a “View” implementation (impl<V> View for TreeMap<V>) and references the “View” trait. Thus, the Full Sequence Workflow is required. This code also defines data-structure invariants (for Node and TreeMap), so the inv_inference step applies. Additionally, there are TODO markers for specifying functions and adding proofs, so both spec_inference and a final proof_generation step are needed.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes (TreeMap and Node are structs with BST-related invariants)
- proof_generation: Yes (due to “TODO: add proof” and related markers)
