Current State:
- The code defines a struct "ModPredicate" implementing "InvariantPredicate<int, u32>" with a TODO placeholder for its "inv" method.
- It uses "AtomicInvariant" for storing values that must satisfy the predicate, but the core invariant predicate is missing its specification details.
- There is no mention of "View" or related View functions in the code.
- There is a "TODO: add specification" placeholder, indicating we need function specifications for the predicate.

Dependencies:
- "ModPredicate::inv" must be defined in a way that ensures the stored values meet the correct odd/even invariant depending on "k".
- The "test" function relies on these invariants to ensure correct assertion behavior.

**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
The code contains a custom data structure (ModPredicate with an InvariantPredicate) and needs a specification for the "inv" function ("TODO: add specification"). There is no mention of View functions or "TODO: add View." Hence, the code qualifies for the Invariant-First workflow to infer type invariants and then add the needed specification.

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – "ModPredicate" is a struct requiring type invariants.
- proof_generation: No – there is no "TODO: add proof" placeholder present.
```
