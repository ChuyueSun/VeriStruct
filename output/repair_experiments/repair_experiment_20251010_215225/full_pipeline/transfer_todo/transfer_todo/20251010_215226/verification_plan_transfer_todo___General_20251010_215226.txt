## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- There is a struct (Account) along with a function (transfer) that lacks proper specification (requires/ensures).
- No invariants are explicitly requested or implied for the Account struct.
- No mentions of “View” or view-related functionality.
- A “TODO: add requires and ensures” comment indicates missing function specifications.

Dependencies:
- The function transfer depends on proper preconditions (e.g., ensuring the transferred amount does not exceed available balances) and clear postconditions indicating the final states of both accounts.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
- The code contains a struct but does not indicate any need or request for type invariants.
- There is an explicit placeholder “TODO: add requires and ensures” for the transfer function, indicating that only function specifications are needed.
- There is no mention of a View function or “TODO: add invariants.”

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No (no invariants are requested or necessary)
- proof_generation: No (no “TODO: add proof” or “TODO: add invariants” markers present)
```
