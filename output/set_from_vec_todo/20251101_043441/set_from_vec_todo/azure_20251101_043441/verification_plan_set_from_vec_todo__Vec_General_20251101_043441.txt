## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a struct (VecSet) which includes a function named "view" returning Set<u64>.
- The "view" function is incomplete; it has a TODO to add requires/ensures.
- The functions (new, insert, contains) all have TODO placeholders for specifications.
- Additional TODOs indicate a need for proofs and invariants.

Dependencies:
- The VecSet struct depends on a correct and complete view function to maintain consistency with its abstract set representation.
- The insert and contains methods must be consistent with the abstract set specified by the view function.
- The presence of “TODO: add proof” and “TODO: add invariant” tasks indicates that proofs and invariants are required for verification completeness.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
- The code explicitly includes a "View" function ("pub closed spec fn view"), indicating that a View-based refinement is required.
- The code also has a struct (VecSet) that likely requires type invariants.
- Multiple TODOs mention adding requires/ensures and proofs, confirming the need for complete verification steps including specification and proof generation.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation (added because of "TODO: add proof" and "TODO: add invariant")

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes (the code defines a struct VecSet requiring invariants)
- proof_generation: Yes (TODO markers explicitly request proof additions)
