## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The file defines a struct "ModPredicate" implementing the "InvariantPredicate" trait for (int, u32), where the "inv" function body is missing (marked with "TODO: add specification").
- The test function uses "AtomicInvariant" with "ModPredicate" but relies on the missing invariant specification to ensure odd/even properties for k=0/1.
- No mentions of any "View" keywords or "TODO: add view" requirements.

Dependencies:
- The "inv" function in "ModPredicate" is needed to define the underlying type-invariant logic for "AtomicInvariant<int, u32, ModPredicate>" objects.
- The correctness of the test function’s assertions depends on a correct specification in "inv".

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
- The code contains a struct data structure ("ModPredicate") for which we must define invariants.
- There is a placeholder "TODO: add specification," indicating we must add or infer specification details (e.g., requires/ensures) but no mention of “View.”
- Therefore, the “Invariant-First Workflow” applies (inv_inference → spec_inference).

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes (we have a struct data structure requiring invariants).
- proof_generation: No ("TODO: add proof" not found).
```
