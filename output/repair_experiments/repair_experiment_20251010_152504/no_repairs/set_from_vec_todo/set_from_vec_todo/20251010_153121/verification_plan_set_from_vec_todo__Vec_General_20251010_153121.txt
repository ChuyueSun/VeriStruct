## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a struct VecSet with a "pub closed spec fn view" indicating a need for a View function.
- Several functions (new, insert, contains) have placeholders for requires/ensures, and there is a "TODO: add proof" marker.
- The data structure's mathematical abstraction is not yet fully specified, and the function specifications are incomplete.

Dependencies:
- The view function depends on the internal representation (vt) of VecSet.
- The invariants and specifications for insert and contains depend on the correctness of the view abstraction.
- A proof is required to demonstrate the correctness of insert and contains with respect to the set abstraction.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
A "view" function is explicitly present in the definition of VecSet, and there are multiple TODO markers requesting both specifications and proofs. Since the code includes a data structure (VecSet) and explicitly references a "View" function, the Full Sequence Workflow is the correct choice. The inv_inference step applies because VecSet is a struct, and we also need the final proof_generation step due to "TODO: add proof."

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes (VecSet is a struct requiring invariants)
- proof_generation: Yes ("TODO: add proof" is present)
```
