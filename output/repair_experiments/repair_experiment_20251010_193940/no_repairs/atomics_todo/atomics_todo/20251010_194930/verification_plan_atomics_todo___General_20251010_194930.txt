Current State:
- The code defines a Lock<T> struct with an invariant that the boolean must match whether the value is Some or None.
- There are explicit “TODO: add specification” and “TODO: add requires and ensures” placeholders for the take function.
- There is also a “TODO: add invariants” placeholder for the loop in take.
- No explicit mention of “View” or “implement View” is present.
- The code is a struct-based data structure, requiring type invariants along with function specifications.

Dependencies:
- The Lock<T> struct’s well_formed function depends on ensuring the boolean matches the Option<T> state.
- The function take needs loop invariants and function specs that rely on the Lock<T> invariant.
- Proof obligations (“TODO: add invariants” and “TODO: add specification”) must reconcile the lock’s field atomic operations with the correctness requirements.

**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
Because Lock<T> is a struct that requires type invariants and there are placeholders for “TODO: add requires/ensures,” the code needs both invariants and specification steps. There is no indication of “View” requirements, so the Full Sequence Workflow is not necessary.

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference
3. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – Lock<T> is a custom struct requiring invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes – “TODO: add invariants” is explicitly present, requiring a final proof step.
