### 1. Analysis Summary
```markdown
Current State:
- The code defines a BST-based TreeMap and Node data structure with several specification placeholders including "TODO: add specification" and "TODO: add requires and ensures".
- There are missing function specifications (requires/ensures clauses) as well as view function bodies for TreeMap, and proof blocks are incomplete (e.g., "TODO: add proof" in insert).
- Critical verification challenges include providing complete specifications for insertion, deletion, and lookup operations while ensuring the BST invariant holds and the view abstraction is correctly defined.

Dependencies:
- TreeMap and Node structs are interdependent; the Node's spec functions (as_map, optional_as_map, well_formed) underpin the TreeMap's type invariant and functional specifications.
- The View implementation for TreeMap depends on a correctly refined view function that presents the tree as a Map.
- Insertion and deletion functions require invariant preservation proofs, so their correct specification (requires/ensures clauses) and associated proofs have direct dependencies on the type invariant and view functions.

### 2. Verification Plan
```markdown
**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
The code explicitly contains a "View" implementation with a placeholder ("TODO: add specification") in the view function, which mandates generating and refining a view function. Additionally, the data structures (TreeMap and Node) are classes that require invariants to be maintained, and there are numerous placeholders for function specifications (requires/ensures). Moreover, there is a "TODO: add proof" marker in TreeMap::insert, triggering proof generation. Therefore, the Full Sequence Workflow is the optimal choice.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference: Generate a view function for TreeMap to abstract its map representation.
2. view_refinement: Refine the generated view to ensure it accurately reflects the BST's map abstraction.
3. inv_inference: Generate type invariant functions for the TreeMap and Node to capture the BST well_formedness properties.
4. spec_inference: Infer the requires and ensures clauses for all functions (e.g., new, insert, delete, get, and auxiliary functions).
5. proof_generation: Generate proofs for any functions with "TODO: add proof", ensuring that the necessary verifications for insertion and deletion operations are completed.

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – the input qualifies as class/struct data structures (TreeMap and Node) needing type invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes – "TODO: add proof" exists in the insert function and possibly other spec placeholders.
