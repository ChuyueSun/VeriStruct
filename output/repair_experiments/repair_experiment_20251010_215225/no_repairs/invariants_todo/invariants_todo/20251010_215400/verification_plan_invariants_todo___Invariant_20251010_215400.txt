## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a struct ModPredicate implementing InvariantPredicate<int, u32> and uses AtomicInvariant in test code.
- There is a “TODO: add specification” placeholder inside the inv function, indicating a need for function specifications.
- No "View" functionality is mentioned or requested.

Dependencies:
- The ModPredicate type’s inv function must ensure that for k = 0, v is even, and for k = 1, v is odd (based on the test requirements).
- The code's correctness depends on the inv function’s specification and ensuring AtomicInvariant::new preconditions are upheld.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
- The code contains a struct ModPredicate that requires a type invariant (InvariantPredicate).
- There is a placeholder “TODO: add specification,” which corresponds to the need for function specs.
- No “View” requirements or hints are present, so we do not need the full sequence workflow.
- Hence, “inv_inference → spec_inference” is appropriate.

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – the struct ModPredicate qualifies as a data structure needing a type invariant.
- proof_generation: No – there is no “TODO: add proof” or “TODO: add invariants” marker.
```
