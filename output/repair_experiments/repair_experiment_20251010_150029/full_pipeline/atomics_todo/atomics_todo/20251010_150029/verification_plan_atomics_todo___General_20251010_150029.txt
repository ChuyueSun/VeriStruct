Current State:
- The code defines a struct Lock<T> that uses an AtomicBool field and has a “TODO: add specification” in its well_formed method, indicating a need for invariants and function specs.
- The function take also has “TODO: add requires and ensures” along with “TODO: add invariants” in the loop, confirming both spec and invariant placeholders.
- No "View" or "TODO: add View" requirements are present, so a View-based workflow is not needed.

Dependencies:
- The Lock<T> struct depends on invariants binding the boolean field state with the Option<T> ghost state.
- The function take depends on ensures/requires conditions reflecting the well-formedness invariant.

**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
The code contains a struct (Lock<T>) requiring type invariants and also has placeholders for requires/ensures specifications. Since there is no mention of “View” requirements, the Invariant-First Workflow is appropriate for generating invariants first, then the function specs. Additionally, “TODO: add invariants” triggers proof_generation as a final step.

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference
3. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – there is a struct Lock<T> that requires invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes – “TODO: add invariants” was found in the code, so proof_generation is appended.
```
