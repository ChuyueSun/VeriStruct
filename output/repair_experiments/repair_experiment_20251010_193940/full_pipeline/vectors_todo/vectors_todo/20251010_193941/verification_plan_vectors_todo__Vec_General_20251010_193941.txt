## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines multiple functions (binary_search, reverse, binary_search_no_spinoff) with “TODO: add specification” comments, but it does not define any custom class or struct requiring a type invariant.
- There are “TODO: add invariants” markers referring to needed loop invariants, not type invariants.

Dependencies:
- No user-defined data structures exist, so no View or type-invariant routines are required.
- All “TODO: add specification” placeholders point to missing requires/ensures clauses for existing functions.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
- The code does not include any user-defined struct or class that needs type invariants, so inv_inference is not applicable.
- There is no mention of Views or “View” implementation requirements.
- The primary placeholders are “TODO: add specification” for each function, indicating the need for requires/ensures clauses only.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference
2. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No – there is no custom class/struct data structure to require type invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes – there are “TODO: add invariants” comments, indicating a need for proof steps (loop invariants).
```
