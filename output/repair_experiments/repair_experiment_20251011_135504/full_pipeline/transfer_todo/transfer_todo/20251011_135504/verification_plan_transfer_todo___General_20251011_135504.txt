## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- A struct Account is defined, but there is no mention of needing an invariant for it.
- The transfer function has a "TODO: add requires and ensures" placeholder, implying we need specification for this function.
- There is no mention of "View" or "TODO: add invariants," so no type-invariant or View-related requirements are indicated.

Dependencies:
- No direct dependency on a View function or type-level invariants.
- The test function already has some requires clauses that prevent arithmetic errors (e.g., ensures no underflow or overflow).

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
The code contains a struct but does not explicitly require or request invariants. There is a "TODO: add requires and ensures" placeholder, indicating we only need function specifications. There are no mentions of "View" or type invariants, so the simplest approach is to generate specifications (requires/ensures) for the transfer function.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No – there is no request for invariants or mention of struct-level invariants.
- proof_generation: No – no "TODO: add proof" or "TODO: add invariants" markers are present.
