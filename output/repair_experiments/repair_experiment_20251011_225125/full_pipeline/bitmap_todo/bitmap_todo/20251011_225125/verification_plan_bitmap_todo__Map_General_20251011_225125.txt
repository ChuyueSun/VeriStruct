## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a struct BitMap containing a Vec<u64> field. It also declares a spec fn view which is explicitly mentioned but not implemented (“TODO: implement view”).
- Several functions have “TODO: add requires and ensures” placeholders. There are also “TODO: add proof” markers in set_bit and or.
- Hence, the code requires a full verification of both the data structure’s views and the function specifications.

Dependencies:
- The BitMap struct’s mathematical abstraction depends on the spec fn view (the future “View” function).
- The correctness of set_bit and or functions depends on proofs referencing their specification clauses.
- Invariants (if any) for BitMap may need to reference the relationship between bits and their representation in the view.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
Because a “view” function is explicitly declared (“spec fn view(&self) -> Seq<bool>”) and marked with a “TODO: implement view,” we must generate and refine a View. The code also defines a struct data structure (BitMap), so we include inv_inference. Additionally, we have specification placeholders (“TODO: add requires and ensures”). Finally, there are “TODO: add proof” markers, so we will append a proof_generation step.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – BitMap is a struct data structure.
- proof_generation: Yes – “TODO: add proof” markers are present.
```
