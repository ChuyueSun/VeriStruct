### Step 1: Analyze the task

This code implements a resource-based data structure, “LogResource,” whose underlying abstract value is given by the enum “LogResourceValue<T>.” There is clearly a notion of a “log” (a sequence) that needs to be reflected in a mathematical abstraction (the “view”) to facilitate reasoning about operations such as “append” or “split.” Moreover, the code includes PCM logic and relies on valid/invalid states for these resources, so invariants (e.g., capturing that “HalfAuthority” logs must be prefixes of a “FullAuthority” log) may be needed. Hence, this code is not just about adding requires/ensures clauses; it also needs a proper “view” function for “LogResource<T>,” along with invariants that relate that view to reality. Therefore, a full sequence workflow that includes defining a “view” and relevant invariants is warranted.

### Step 2: Choose the Workflow

**Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow  
**Explanation:** Because “LogResource<T>” and “LogResourceValue<T>” are data structures requiring a clear mathematical abstraction, we must first define and refine a view, then capture any necessary invariants, and finally write the function specifications.
