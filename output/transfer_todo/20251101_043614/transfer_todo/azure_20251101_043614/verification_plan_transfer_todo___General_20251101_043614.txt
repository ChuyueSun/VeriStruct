Current State:
- The code defines a struct (Account) and a function (transfer) that requires specification (requires/ensures clauses).
- There is no mention or indication of needing a structural invariant on Account nor any “View” requirement.
- The “TODO” in the code explicitly asks for requires/ensures but not for proofs or invariants.

Dependencies:
- The only identified dependency is that the function transfer must include appropriate requires and ensures clauses (e.g., ensuring no underflow/overflow on balances).

```markdown
**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
The code has a “TODO: add requires and ensures,” indicating a need for function specifications. There is no explicit request for a type invariant on the Account struct, and there are no references to Views or “TODO: add View.” Therefore, only specification inference is needed.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No – no invariant-related TODO or requirement is present.
- proof_generation: No – there is no “TODO: add proof” or “TODO: add invariants.”
