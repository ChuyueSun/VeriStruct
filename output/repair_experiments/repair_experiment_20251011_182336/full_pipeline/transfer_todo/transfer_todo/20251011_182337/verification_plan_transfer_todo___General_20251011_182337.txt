## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a simple Account struct and a transfer function.
- There is a placeholder ("TODO: add requires and ensures") in the transfer function but no mention of invariants or View.
- Hence, only function specifications are requested.

Dependencies:
- The transfer function depends on conditions ensuring valid use of orig and dest accounts.
- No invariant or View dependencies are indicated.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
- There is a struct, but there is no explicit need for invariants: no "TODO: add invariants" or similar indications.
- The only placeholder is for requires/ensures clauses.
- There is no mention of View or View-related requirements.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No – the code does not indicate a need for type invariants.
- proof_generation: No – there is no "TODO: add proof" or "TODO: add invariants."
```
