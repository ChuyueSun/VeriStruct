Current State:
- The code defines a BitMap struct with several methods and a spec fn view that is unimplemented.
- There are multiple "TODO" markers requesting requires, ensures, and proofs (including a loop invariant).
- The presence of an explicit "view" function triggers the need for a fully refined View.
- A struct data structure is present, suggesting possible invariants.

Dependencies:
- BitMap → view() must match the internal bits Vec<u64> representation with a Seq<bool>.
- The from, get_bit, set_bit, and or methods depend on the correctness of view() and may require invariants about bits.
- Proof blocks (set_bit_proof, bit_or_64_proof) rely on macros and bit-vector logic for correctness.

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
This code explicitly contains a "spec fn view" that is not implemented, which necessitates generating and refining a View. It also has specification placeholders ("TODO: add requires/ensures") and a struct data structure, so we include inv_inference. Finally, there are "TODO: add proof" markers, so proof_generation is appended.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes - BitMap is a struct data structure.
- proof_generation: Yes - found "TODO: add proof" and "TODO: add invariants" markers.
```
