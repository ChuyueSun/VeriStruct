## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a RingBuffer struct that implements a View trait, but the View function is incomplete ("TODO: add specification").
- Each method of the RingBuffer is missing requires/ensures clauses, and there are multiple "TODO: add proof" placeholders.
- The code includes a type_invariant but lacks an actual body, so its correctness conditions are incomplete.
- Additional modulo specifications (mod_auto_plus, mod_auto_minus, mod_auto) are present, but those are proven via lemma_mod_auto and do not directly relate to the RingBuffer’s verification aside from providing a background for mathematical properties.

Identified Missing Components:
- Proper View function for the RingBuffer to capture its abstract mathematical model.
- Type invariants or detailed proof statements for correctness of internal structures and methods.
- Requires and ensures clauses for ring buffer methods (e.g., len, has_elements, is_full, enqueue, dequeue, available_len).
- Proof blocks fulfilling the "TODO: add proof" notes.

Critical Verification Challenges:
- Ensuring the ring buffer functionality matches its intended specification, particularly under wraparound conditions.
- Defining and maintaining a coherent relationship between the ring buffer’s structural invariant, its View function, and each method’s specification.

Dependencies:
- The RingBuffer struct’s correctness depends on a valid and complete View function to describe its abstract state.
- Each method’s correctness depends on properly stated requires/ensures that align with the ring buffer’s invariant and View.
- Proofs must utilize the ring buffer’s invariant and updated View to show each method preserves correctness conditions.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
- The code explicitly implements a "View" trait with a "TODO: add specification," indicating a needed View function.
- The code defines a struct (RingBuffer) and requires type invariants and function specifications, matching the criteria for including inv_inference and spec_inference.
- The presence of "TODO: add proof" lines triggers an additional proof_generation step at the end.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes (the RingBuffer is a data structure with type invariants).
- proof_generation: Yes (the code contains "TODO: add proof" placeholders).
```
