## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code consists of three functions (binary_search, reverse, binary_search_no_spinoff) operating on standard library vectors, plus test code.
- Each function contains "TODO: add specification" and "TODO: add invariants" comments, indicating missing function-level requires/ensures clauses and loop invariants.
- There is no custom class/struct data structure defined, so no type invariants are needed and no View implementation is required.

Dependencies:
- Functions depend on properly formulated function specifications (requires/ensures) and loop invariants.
- Proofs will rely on these specifications and invariants to establish correctness.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
Since there is no custom class/struct data structure, no type invariants or View functions are needed. The code only calls for additional function specifications (and loop invariants) through the "TODO: add specification" placeholders.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference
2. proof_generation  (appended because "TODO: add invariants" is present)

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No – there is no custom class/struct data structure needing a type invariant.
- proof_generation: Yes – the code has "TODO: add invariants," indicating a proof-related TODO.
```
