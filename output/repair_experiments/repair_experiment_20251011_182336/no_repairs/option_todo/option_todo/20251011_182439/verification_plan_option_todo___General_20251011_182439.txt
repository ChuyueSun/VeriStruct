Current State:
- The code contains an enum MyOption with missing specifications (TODOs for requires/ensures).
- There are no View-related requirements nor invariant-related TODOs.
- Thus, only function specifications need to be generated.

Dependencies:
- MyOption is used in several functions (e.g., or, is_some, is_none, as_ref, unwrap) that each require specifications.
- The test code relies on the correctness of these specifications to pass asserts.

```

```markdown
**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
The code includes a custom enum but does not mention any need for type invariants. There are no “TODO: add invariants” markers or View-related placeholders. Instead, the code specifically requests “TODO: add specification” and “TODO: add requires/ensures,” which indicates that only function specifications are needed.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No – there is no mention of or need for type invariants here.
- proof_generation: No – there are no “TODO: add proof” markers present.
```
