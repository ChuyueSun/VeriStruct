## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a RingBuffer<T> struct and explicitly implements the View trait for it.
- Multiple TODO comments request adding specifications (requires/ensures), type invariants, and proofs.
- The code contains a #[verifier::type_invariant] annotation for RingBuffer<T>, requiring an invariant.
- Several methods contain "TODO: add proof" placeholders indicating proof obligations.

Dependencies:
- RingBuffer<T> depends on a proper View function for its abstraction.
- The invariants within RingBuffer<T> must be consistent with that View.
- The method specifications (requires/ensures) depend on the type invariants and the View abstraction.
- The proofs (“TODO: add proof”) must validate the method specifications and invariants.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
The code explicitly references and implements the View trait (e.g., "impl<T: Copy> View for RingBuffer<T>"), indicating that a complete workflow with view inference/refinement is required. Since RingBuffer<T> is a struct needing invariants, we include inv_inference. The code also has “TODO: add proof,” so we append proof_generation as the final step.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes, the input is a struct (RingBuffer<T>) with a #[verifier::type_invariant].
- proof_generation: Yes, “TODO: add proof” and “TODO: add invariants” exist in the code.
