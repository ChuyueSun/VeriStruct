Current State:
- The BitMap data structure has a stub "view" function marked “TODO: implement view”.
- Several methods (from, get_bit, set_bit, or) have “TODO: add requires and ensures” placeholders.
- There are “TODO: add proof” comments for set_bit (and possibly elsewhere).
- A struct BitMap exists, so type invariants may be relevant.
- Verification depends on ensuring the view function accurately reflects the bits vector, plus function specs and proofs.

Dependencies:
- The BitMap.view() functionality depends on the internal bits array and how to translate each bit to a boolean sequence.
- set_bit and get_bit rely on the macros get_bit64_macro/set_bit64_macro and must preserve correctness of the view.
- All methods that modify BitMap should maintain internal invariants and must align with the view specification and declared ensures clauses.

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
The code explicitly has a "spec fn view" with a TODO comment and references to "View." According to the rules, any explicit requirement for a View function triggers the Full Sequence Workflow. Additionally, we have a struct (BitMap), so inv_inference is included. The presence of "TODO: add proof" necessitates appending proof_generation.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – BitMap is a struct needing type invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes – Found “TODO: add proof” markers in the code.
