## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The RingBuffer<T> struct is missing a “View” specification (marked as "TODO: add specification" in the impl View).
- The RingBuffer<T> has a type invariant stub (inv) with "TODO: add specification".
- Multiple methods (len, has_elements, is_full, etc.) have “TODO: add requires and ensures”.
- Several methods also have “TODO: add proof” sections.
- Overall, we need a full solution that includes a View function, invariants, function specs, and corresponding proofs.

Dependencies:
- The RingBuffer<T>’s mathematical model (View) must be established before refining invariants or function specs.
- The ring buffer’s methods (enqueue, dequeue, etc.) depend on the correctness of the type invariant.
- Proof obligations (marked as “TODO: add proof”) depend on the completed specifications and invariants.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
The code explicitly implements "View" for the RingBuffer<T> and includes a “TODO: add specification” in that View impl. It also defines a struct that requires a type invariant along with requires/ensures and proofs. These conditions mandate generating and refining a View function, inferring invariants, and completing specifications, necessitating the Full Sequence Workflow. Since RingBuffer is a struct, the code qualifies for inv_inference.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation  (due to “TODO: add proof” placeholders)

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes - RingBuffer<T> is a struct requiring a type invariant.
- proof_generation: Yes - because of the “TODO: add proof” sections present in the code.
