# Prompt

## Instruction
Your mission is to fix the arithmetic underflow/overflow error for the following code.
Basically, for each variable involved in the expression `i1 + (i2 - i1) / 2' in line `let ix = i1 + (i2 - i1) / 2;' of the program, there are several general ways to fix the error:

0. Make sure the value of EVERY variable involved in this expression is specified as a loop invariant.
1. Add a bound for the whole expression `i1 + (i2 - i1) / 2' as a loop invariant or as an assert. This bound can be a constant value, or another expression whose bound has been specified through loop invariants or asserts.
2. Or, add BOTH a lower bound (i.e. x > ..., x >= ...) AND an upper bound (i.e., x < ..., x <= ...) as an assertion or a loop invariant if they are in a loop body for EACH variable involved in the expression i1 + (i2 - i1) / 2. If the variable is a loop index variable, make sure that its lower bound (e.g., its initial value at the beginning of the loop) and upper bound (based on the loop-exit condition) are specified as loop invariants. You may use the loop index variable in the invariant.

Do not miss any variable in `i1 + (i2 - i1) / 2', and do NOT add bound information related to any other variables. Please do not change function post-conditions.
Response requirements:
Respond with the verus code only, do not include any explanation.
You should only add loop invariants, and you should NOT make any other changes to the program.

Hint for the upper bound:
1. For the lower/upper bound, you don't always need to find the exact or strict value. Your mission is to find a provable bound for Verus, which is usually based on the loop index, like `car <= CONSTANT * index`.
2. If the expression involves the loop index or is updated during each loop iteration, use the loop index variable as the upper or lower bound in the invariant instead of using the CONSTANT alone!
3. If there is a non-linear upper bound, you can use a constant to represent part of the expression (e.g., a * CONSTANT_RELATED_TO_b) to make it linear. However, ensure that at least one variable remains (DO NOT USE A CONSTANT TO REPLACE THE WHOLE NON-LINEAR). This approach makes it easier to prove.
4. You may use conditional loop invariants to specify the upper bound based on the loop index. For example, `i > 0 ==> x < 10 * i` means that if `i` is greater than 0, then `x` is less than 10 times `i`.
