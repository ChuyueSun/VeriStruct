It looks like you’re interested in adding Verus-style specifications (e.g., requires/ensures clauses, invariants, etc.) or possibly other verification conditions to your Rust code. Could you say more about what verification goals or invariants you’d like to encode? For instance, are you aiming to:
• ensure that a certain function returns a value with specific properties,
• maintain an invariant about some data structure,
• or introduce pre-/post-conditions about the parameters and results of your functions?

If you can clarify these goals, I can show how to add the relevant Verus specifications (e.g., requires/ensures, type invariants, and so on) to help prove those properties.
