Current State:
- The struct ModPredicate implements InvariantPredicate but has a “TODO: add specification” placeholder for its inv function.
- The code uses AtomicInvariant with different k values (0 or 1) to enforce even/odd constraints on the stored u32.
- There is no mention or requirement for a View function.

Dependencies:
- The ModPredicate::inv function must relate k to v’s parity (k=0 => v even, k=1 => v odd).
- The test function relies on the correctness of the ‘inv’ predicate for the invariants to hold.

**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
This code includes a struct (ModPredicate) needing a type-level invariant function and contains a “TODO: add specification” placeholder for the inv function. There is no mention of a View requirement. Hence, we apply the Invariant-First Workflow to properly define type invariants followed by function specifications.

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – ModPredicate is a data-structure-like type (implements InvariantPredicate).
- proof_generation: No – No “TODO: add proof” or “TODO: add invariants” markers were found.
```
