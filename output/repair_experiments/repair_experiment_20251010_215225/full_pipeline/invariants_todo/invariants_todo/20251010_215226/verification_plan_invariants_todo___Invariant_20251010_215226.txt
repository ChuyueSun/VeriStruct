Current State:
- The code defines a trivial struct "ModPredicate" implementing "InvariantPredicate<int, u32>" with a placeholder "TODO: add specification" for the inv function.
- There are no fields in "ModPredicate" that require a type invariant; the only missing piece is the specification logic (i.e., the body of inv).
- No references to "View" or "TODO: add View" are found, and there is no mention of needing a data-structure-level invariant.

Dependencies:
- The "inv" function in "ModPredicate" must reflect the odd/even logic corresponding to the given "k" values in the test code.
- The other functions rely on "ModPredicate::inv" being correctly specified but do not require additional invariants or proofs outside of that specification.

```

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
Since "ModPredicate" is an empty struct and does not need a type invariant, and there is a “TODO: add specification” placeholder but no mention of "View" or type invariants, the Specification-Only Workflow is sufficient. We only need to provide the function specification for the "inv" function.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No – "ModPredicate" does not store any fields needing a type invariant.
- proof_generation: No – there is no "TODO: add proof" or "TODO: add invariants" marker.
```
