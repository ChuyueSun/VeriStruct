## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The TreeMap and Node structs form a BST data structure with a type invariant (well_formed).
- The "View" trait is partially implemented for TreeMap, but its spec function is incomplete.
- Many functions have “TODO: add specification” and at least one function has “TODO: add proof,” indicating missing specifications and proof obligations.
- The core BST properties (key ordering, mapping relationship) are present but need formal specs.

Dependencies:
- The BST property depends on Node::well_formed propagating up to TreeMap::well_formed.
- The view() function depends on TreeMap::as_map, which in turn relies on Node::as_map.
- Insertion, deletion, and lookup methods rely on the underlying BST invariant (well_formed) and require ensures clauses matching their expected map representations.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
- The code explicitly contains an implementation of the “View” trait for TreeMap, requiring View-related specifications.
- The data structure (TreeMap and Node) is a struct-based BST with type invariants, so we include inv_inference.
- The presence of “TODO: add proof” triggers an additional proof_generation step at the end.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes (the code includes struct data with a type invariant).
- proof_generation: Yes (“TODO: add proof” is present).
