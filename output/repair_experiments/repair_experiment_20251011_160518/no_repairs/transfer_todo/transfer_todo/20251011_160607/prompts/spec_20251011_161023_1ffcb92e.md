# Prompt

## System
You are a helpful AI assistant specialized in Verus formal verification.

## Instruction
You are an expert in Verus (a Rust-based verification framework). Given the following Rust code that defines a data structure with private fields, implement the invariant functions that are already declared in the code. Common names for these functions are `well_formed`, `inv`, or `invariant`. You are allowed to reference private fields directly (i.e., do not rely on "view" conversions unless absolutely necessary).

IMPORTANT:
- ONLY implement invariant functions that already exist in the code - do not create new ones.
- Look for functions named `well_formed`, `inv`, `invariant`, `inv`, or similar that are marked with TODO or are empty.
- Do NOT rename existing functions or create new `spec fn inv` functions unless explicitly requested.
- When `struct_with_invariants` is present in the input file, use library knowledge to construct the correct invariant. Use `invariant on field with` to construct the invariants for the target class.
- Use `===` instead of `==>` and `!==>` for bidirectional equivalence in invariants - this is more precise for verification.
- Return the ENTIRE file with your changes integrated into the original code, not just the inv function definition.
- Do not modify other parts of the code.
- Do not add explanatory text.
- Do NOT fill in any proofs or non-inv specifications - leave all TODOs and proof obligations untouched.
- Focus ONLY on implementing existing invariant functions - do not attempt to complete any other specifications or proofs.
- If you find multiple invariant functions to implement (e.g., both `well_formed` and `inv`), implement all of them while preserving their original names.

# Verus Common Knowledge

## Important Notes
- ALWAYS use parentheses whenever possible for clarity!
- Don't delete existing non-buggy `#[trigger]`!
- Don't change "unwind" to `(unwind) as bool`!
- Return the complete modified Rust code in your response without explanations.
- Keep top level docstrings at the top of the file, before `verus! {`. Do not place them after the `verus! {` declaration.
- Don't change any function signatures.

## Spec Functions
1. No Direct Method Calls:
   In a spec function, you cannot directly call instance methods such as vector.is_full().
2. Use the @ Operator:
   To invoke methods on a variable within a spec, first convert it to its specification-level representation View with @.
3. Always use vector.len() instead of vector@.len().
4. Simplify Boolean Conjunctions:
   When combining multiple conditions, avoid excessive &&&. Fewer (or well-structured) conjunctions make the spec code easier to read and debug.
5. Parentheses Usage:
   ALWAYS wrap conditions in parentheses, even for simple expressions. This makes precedence explicit and prevents errors.

## Operators
Verus extends Rust logical operators with low-precedence forms that are especially helpful in specification code:

Standard Operators: &&, ||, ==>, <==>
Low-Precedence Variants: &&& and |||

The meaning of &&& is the same as && (logical AND), and ||| is the same as || (logical OR), but with lower precedence. This allows you to write conditions in a "bulleted list" style that remains grouped in a logical manner:

```
&&& a ==> b
&&& c
&&& d <==> e && f
```

is equivalent to:

```
(a ==> b) && c && (d <==> (e && f))
```

Note:
- Implication (==>) and equivalence (<==>) bind more tightly than &&& and |||.
- Using &&&/||| can make long specifications clearer by grouping logical clauses neatly.


# Verus Invariant Guidelines

1. An invariant is a property that must hold for all valid instances of the data structure

2. It should consider the relationships between fields and enforce structural properties

3. For collections, consider:
   - Size/capacity constraints
   - Range bounds for indices
   - Ordering properties
   - Non-nullity of critical components

4. Use `&&` for simple conjunctions and `&&&` for more complex ones

5. For circular data structures, think about how the head/tail pointers relate to each other

6. Include range checks when appropriate (e.g., indices must be less than length)


# Verus Match Syntax Guidelines

## Using `matches!` Macro

In Verus, the `matches!` macro must use Rust's standard macro syntax:

```rust
// CORRECT
pub open spec fn is_Some<A>(opt: MyOption<A>) -> bool {
    matches!(opt, MyOption::Some(_))
}

// INCORRECT - don't use this syntax
pub open spec fn is_Some<A>(opt: MyOption<A>) -> bool {
    matches opt {
        MyOption::Some(_) => true,
        MyOption::None => false,
    }
}
```

## Match with `arbitrary()` in Spec Functions

When writing spec functions that match on patterns with impossible/unreachable branches, use `arbitrary()` instead of `unreachable!()`:

```rust
// CORRECT
pub open spec fn get_Some_0<A>(opt: MyOption<A>) -> A
    recommends is_Some(opt)
{
    match opt {
        MyOption::Some(a) => a,
        MyOption::None => arbitrary(), // For unreachable branches in spec functions
    }
}

// INCORRECT
pub open spec fn get_Some_0<A>(opt: MyOption<A>) -> A
    recommends is_Some(opt)
{
    match opt {
        MyOption::Some(a) => a,
        MyOption::None => unreachable!(), // Don't use this in spec functions
    }
}
```

## Match in Executable Functions

For unreachable branches in executable functions, use `unreached()`:

```rust
pub fn unwrap(self) -> (a: A)
    requires
        is_Some(self),
    ensures
        a == get_Some_0(self),
{
    match self {
        MyOption::Some(a) => a,
        MyOption::None => unreached(), // For unreachable branches in exec functions
    }
}
```

## Match in Proof Functions

For unreachable branches in proof functions, use `proof_from_false()`:

```rust
pub proof fn tracked_unwrap(tracked self) -> (tracked a: A)
    requires
        is_Some(self),
    ensures
        a == get_Some_0(self),
{
    match self {
        MyOption::Some(a) => a,
        MyOption::None => proof_from_false(), // For unreachable branches in proof functions
    }
}
```

## verification_plan

```markdown
Current State:
- The code defines a struct (Account) and a function (transfer) with a "TODO: add requires and ensures" placeholder.
- There is no mention of any View function or invariant statements, but the presence of a struct suggests invariants may be needed.
- No explicit "View" or "TODO: add View" references exist, so a View-based workflow is not indicated.

Dependencies:
- The struct Account might require invariants (e.g., ensuring balance remains nonnegative).
- The transfer function requires specification clauses (requires/ensures) for correctness.

```

```markdown
**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
Because the code defines a struct (Account) and there is a "TODO: add requires and ensures" placeholder, this indicates that both invariants and function specifications may be needed. There are no references to Views, so the Full Sequence Workflow is not appropriate. Hence, we use the Invariant-First approach (inv_inference → spec_inference) for struct-based verification needs.

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes - Account is a struct that may require type invariants.
- proof_generation: No - There is no "TODO: add proof" or "TODO: add invariants" marker.
```

    dest.balance = dest.balance + amount;

pub fn test(init_balance: u64, transfer_amount: u64)

    transfer_amount > 0,
    init_balance < u64::MAX - transfer_amount,

    let mut acc1 = Account { balance: init_balance };
    let mut acc2 = Account { balance: 0 };
    transfer(&mut acc1, &mut acc2, transfer_amount);
