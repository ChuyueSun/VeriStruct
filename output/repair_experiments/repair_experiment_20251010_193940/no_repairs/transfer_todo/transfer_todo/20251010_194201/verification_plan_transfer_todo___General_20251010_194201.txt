Current State:
- The code contains a struct (Account) but no mention of needing a type invariant.
- The function transfer has a placeholder "TODO: add requires and ensures" indicating a need for a function specification.
- There is no indication of a required View function or any invariants for Account.

Dependencies:
- The transfer function depends on proper preconditions and postconditions (requires/ensures).
- No explicit dependencies on invariants or View implementations.

```

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
The code has a struct but does not request invariants, only "TODO: add requires and ensures" for the transfer function. There is no mention of a "View" or an invariant requirement, so a minimal specification approach suffices.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No (no explicit need for type invariants)
- proof_generation: No (no "TODO: add proof" or "TODO: add invariants" found)
```
