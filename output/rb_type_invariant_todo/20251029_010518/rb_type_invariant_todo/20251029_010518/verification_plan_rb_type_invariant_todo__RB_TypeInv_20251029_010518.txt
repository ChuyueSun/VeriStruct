## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a RingBuffer<T> struct and explicitly implements "impl<T: Copy> View for RingBuffer<T>" with a placeholder comment "TODO: add specification".
- Each method in RingBuffer (e.g., len, has_elements, is_full, new, enqueue, dequeue, available_len) has "TODO: add requires and ensures" and "TODO: add proof" markers.
- The ring buffer has a type invariant annotation ("#[verifier::type_invariant]") that is unfinished.

Identified Missing Components:
- A proper View function for RingBuffer<T>.
- Invariants for the ring buffer data structure.
- Requires/ensures clauses (function specifications) for each method.
- Proofs addressing the "TODO: add proof" markers.

Critical Verification Challenges:
- Constructing a correct mathematical View for RingBuffer.
- Inferring and verifying all required invariants and specifications.
- Ensuring each method’s requires/ensures clauses align with the ring buffer's type invariant and View.

Dependencies:
- The ring buffer’s View depends on how the fields (head, tail, ring) are modeled mathematically.
- Each method’s specification depends on the type invariant and the ring buffer’s View.
- The ring buffer’s proofs require established invariants and specifications to demonstrate correctness.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
The code explicitly contains “impl<T: Copy> View for RingBuffer<T>” and “TODO: add specification” for that View implementation. We also have a struct data structure (RingBuffer) with a type_invariant, so inv_inference is relevant. Since the code needs both View and invariant specification, we use the full sequence workflow.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes — RingBuffer is a struct with a “#[verifier::type_invariant]” marker.
- proof_generation: Yes — The code includes “TODO: add proof” markers.
