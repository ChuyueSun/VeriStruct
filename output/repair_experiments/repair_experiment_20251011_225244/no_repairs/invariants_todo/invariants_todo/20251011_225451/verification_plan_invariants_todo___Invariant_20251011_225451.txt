Current State:
- The code defines a struct "ModPredicate" that implements "InvariantPredicate<int, u32>", but the invariant function body is left as a TODO with “// TODO: add specification.”
- This indicates missing specification details for the invariant predicate (no concrete requires/ensures provided for how (k, v) must relate).
- No View functions or references to "View" are present.
- The code is a data-structure-like definition requiring invariants and also requests a specification.

Dependencies:
- "inv" method in "ModPredicate" depends on how (k, v) must satisfy certain mathematical constraints for the invariant.
- The test function correctness (assertions inside open blocks) depends on the correctness of "ModPredicate::inv".

**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
The code uses a struct (ModPredicate) that implements an invariant predicate, indicating a need for type invariants. It also contains a "TODO: add specification" placeholder, indicating specification requirements. No "View" keywords or View-related requirements appear, so the full sequence workflow is not needed.

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes - the code contains a struct whose type invariants need to be clarified.
- proof_generation: No - there are no "TODO: add proof" or "TODO: add invariants" markers.
