Current State:
- The code defines a struct (ModPredicate) implementing InvariantPredicate<int, u32> but leaves its specification body empty with "TODO: add specification".
- There is a data structure present (ModPredicate) that needs an invariant definition, and the user explicitly requests adding specifications in the code.
- No "View" requirements or keywords are present.

Dependencies:
- The ModPredicate struct’s inv function must satisfy the InvariantPredicate trait requirements.
- The test function depends on ModPredicate’s invariant to ensure invariants about even/odd values.

**Selected Workflow:** Invariant-First Workflow

**Justification:**
The code contains a struct (ModPredicate) requiring an invariant function and also has a "TODO: add specification" placeholder. This indicates that both an invariant and a specification are needed. There is no mention of a View function, so a full View-based sequence is unnecessary.

**Execution Steps:**
1. inv_inference
2. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes - ModPredicate is a data structure (struct) requiring invariants.
- proof_generation: No - "TODO: add specification" is present, but there's no "TODO: add proof" or "TODO: add invariants" marker.
```
