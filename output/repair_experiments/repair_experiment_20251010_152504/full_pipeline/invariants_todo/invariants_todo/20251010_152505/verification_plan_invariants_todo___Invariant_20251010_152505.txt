## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a struct ModPredicate implementing the InvariantPredicate trait but leaves the inv function body as a TODO item (“// TODO: add specification”).
- No View-related functionality or placeholders are mentioned in the code.
- The ModPredicate struct has no fields, so it does not require a type invariant; rather, the code only needs a functional (requires/ensures) specification for the inv function.

Dependencies:
- The AtomicInvariant relies on ModPredicate::inv(k, v) to enforce that values are odd or even depending on the integer k.
- No additional data structure invariants or View functions are referenced.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
There is no mention of a required View function or type invariant. The code has a “// TODO: add specification” placeholder, indicating the need for function specifications only. Hence, the best fit is the Specification-Only Workflow.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No – the struct ModPredicate is empty and does not require an internal type invariant.
- proof_generation: No – the code does not contain “TODO: add proof” or “TODO: add invariants.”
```
