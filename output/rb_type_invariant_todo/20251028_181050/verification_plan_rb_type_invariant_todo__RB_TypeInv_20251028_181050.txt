## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a "RingBuffer<T>" struct with a type invariant, as well as a "View" implementation placeholder.
- The ring buffer methods have "TODO" placeholders for requires/ensures specifications and proofs.
- The code explicitly contains an "impl<T: Copy> View for RingBuffer<T>" indicating a requirement for a proper View function.

Identified Missing Components:
- A formal View function body for the "RingBuffer".
- Type invariants and function specifications for "RingBuffer" methods (e.g., requires/ensures).
- Proof blocks for verifying ring-buffer correctness.

Critical Verification Challenges:
- Ensuring the ring buffer invariant correctly captures the relationship between head, tail, and ring capacity.
- Generating the correct specification for the "View" implementation to represent the ring buffer's abstract state.
- Proving total correctness (requires, ensures, invariants, and detailed proofs).

Dependencies:
- "RingBuffer" struct depends on a properly defined View function and type invariants to enable verification.
- Each public method (len, has_elements, is_full, enqueue, dequeue, available_len) depends on well-formed requires/ensures to link with the ring buffer invariant and View.
- Proof obligations rely on the ring buffer’s type invariant and the View specification to ensure correctness.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
- The code references "impl<T: Copy> View for RingBuffer<T>", explicitly requiring a View implementation, which triggers the Full Sequence Workflow.
- It is a struct (RingBuffer) needing type invariants.
- Multiple "TODO: add proof" markers exist, confirming the need for final proof generation after the main workflow.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes - RingBuffer<T> is a struct requiring a type invariant.
- proof_generation: Yes - "TODO: add proof" markers are present in the code.
