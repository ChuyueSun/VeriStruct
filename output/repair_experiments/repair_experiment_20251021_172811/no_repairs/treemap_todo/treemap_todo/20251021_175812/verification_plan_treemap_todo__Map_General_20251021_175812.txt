## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a TreeMap data structure with an internal Node struct, both requiring BST invariants.
- The TreeMap implements the "View" trait, indicating a need for a view-based verification.
- Several "TODO" markers exist for specifications (e.g., "TODO: add specification", "TODO: add requires and ensures") and for proofs (e.g., "TODO: add proof").
- No specific compiler error details are provided, but the code is evidently missing necessary verification elements.

Identified Missing Components:
- Explicit specification clauses (requires, ensures) in TreeMap methods (new, insert, delete, get).
- A complete specification for the view() method (View trait).
- Proof blocks to satisfy "TODO: add proof" comments.

Critical Verification Challenges:
- Ensuring the tree invariants hold under insertions/deletions.
- Formalizing spec clauses for the newly introduced methods and the view.

Dependencies:
- The TreeMap’s well_formed invariant depends on the Node’s well_formed property.
- The optional_as_map function is used throughout the Node and TreeMap methods for specification.
- Proofs for node insertion/deletion correctness rely on the BST invariant in Node.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
This code explicitly uses the "View" trait implementation and references a "view" function, triggering the Full Sequence Workflow. The TreeMap is a struct requiring invariants, and there are clear "TODO: add specification" markers. Additionally, because there is a "TODO: add proof," a final proof_generation step is appended.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference   (applicable since Node/TreeMap are struct data structures)
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation   (triggered by "TODO: add proof" markers)

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes (TreeMap and Node are structs needing type invariants)
- proof_generation: Yes ("TODO: add proof" is present in the code)
```
