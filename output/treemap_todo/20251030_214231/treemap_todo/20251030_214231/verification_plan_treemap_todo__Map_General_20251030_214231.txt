### 1. Analysis Summary
- Current State:
  - The code defines two struct types, Node and TreeMap, representing a binary search tree with associated map abstractions.
  - There are "TODO" markers for adding specifications (requires/ensures), view specifications, and proofs, indicating that several verification components are missing.
  - The implementation explicitly uses the "View" trait for TreeMap, which requires proper view inference and refinement.
- Identified Missing Components:
  - Specification details for the TreeMap's as_map function and the View implementation.
  - Requires/ensures clauses for TreeMap methods (new, insert, delete, get) and missing proof blocks.
- Critical Verification Challenges:
  - Ensuring that the view functions correctly capture the abstract map representation.
  - Verifying that all BST invariants are maintained through the insertion and deletion operations.

- Dependencies:
  - The Node methods (such as optional_as_map, as_map, well_formed) form the basis for both the view and the verification of BST properties.
  - The TreeMap type invariant depends on the Node's well_formed() spec.
  - The implementation of the View trait for TreeMap depends on the as_map conversion, linking concrete data structure semantics with the abstract view.

### 2. Verification Plan
**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
The code explicitly contains the "View" keyword and requires a View implementation for TreeMap. Additionally, it defines class/struct data structures (TreeMap and Node) that necessitate type invariants and contains multiple "TODO" markers for adding proofs and specification elements. Therefore, the optimal choice is the Full Sequence Workflow: view_inference → view_refinement → inv_inference → spec_inference, with an appended proof_generation step due to the "TODO: add proof" markers.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation (appended because of the "TODO: add proof" markers)

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – the input includes class/struct data structures (Node and TreeMap) that require invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes – markers such as "TODO: add proof" and placeholders for specifications indicate that additional proofs should be generated after the specification step.
