### Step 1: Analyze the task

The provided code defines a custom enum MyOption<A> with several functions (e.g., is_Some, is_None, get_Some_0, unwrap, Or, or, etc.) that need specifications. However, the data structure is fairly simple, and does not include complex mutable fields or intricate internal layouts that would require a detailed “view” function. Typically, a view function is more relevant for linked data structures, trees, or other scenarios needing richer abstractions and loop invariants. Here, we can capture correctness with straightforward requires/ensures specifications directly on the functions. Therefore, a large-scale View inference is not strictly necessary.

### Step 2: Choose the Workflow

**Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow  
**Explanation:** The MyOption type is a simple enum without complex internal data. Its functions can be verified with direct function specifications (requires/ensures clauses) rather than a dedicated view function. Hence, proceeding directly with specification inference is most suitable.
