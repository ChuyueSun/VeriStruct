# 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines an enum MyOption, with several public spec functions and regular functions missing requires/ensures clauses.
- There are placeholders such as "TODO: add specification" and "TODO: add requires and ensures," indicating a need for function specifications.
- There is no mention of invariants for a class/struct data structure and no use of “View” or “implement View”.

Dependencies:
- The primary dependencies are between the enum functions and their respective specifications.
- No additional structural or view dependencies identified.

# 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
The code is not a class/struct, and there are placeholders explicitly requesting function specifications ("TODO: add specification" / "TODO: add requires and ensures"). There is no mention of type invariants, nor any View requirements, so the Specification-Only Workflow is appropriate.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No – this applies to class/struct data structures, which is not the case here.
- proof_generation: No – there are no "TODO: add proof" or "TODO: add invariants" markers.
```
