## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines an enum MyOption<A> with various functions, all marked with "TODO: add specification" or "TODO: add requires and ensures".
- There is no explicit requirement or TODO for a View function or data-structure-level invariants.
- The enum does not exhibit any user-defined type invariants or mention "TODO: add invariants".

Dependencies:
- Each function (like Or, is_Some, get_Some_0, etc.) depends on having suitable requires/ensures clauses for correct specification.
- No dependencies on a custom View function for MyOption.
- No invariants or class/struct type constraints need to be inferred.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
- The code is an enum rather than a struct and does not require type invariants.
- There are no "TODO: add View" or "implement View" markers indicating a need for view_inference or view_refinement.
- The only placeholders are related to function specifications ("TODO: add specification" and "TODO: add requires and ensures"), so the Specification-Only Workflow is appropriate.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No – The code defines an enum without a need for type invariants.
- proof_generation: No – There are no "TODO: add proof"/"TODO: add invariants" markers in the code.
