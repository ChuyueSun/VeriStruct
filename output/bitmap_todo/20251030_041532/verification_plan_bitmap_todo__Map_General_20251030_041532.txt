Current State:
- The code defines a struct BitMap with an unimplemented "view" function and several placeholder "TODO" comments indicating missing specifications ("TODO: add requires and ensures") and a proof block ("TODO: add proof").
- Because "view" is explicitly mentioned and a struct is present, a complete verification solution with a View function is needed.
- There is also a "TODO: implement view" requirement, indicating that View inference is required.
- The BitMap struct will likely require invariants, and multiple methods have missing specifications (requires/ensures).
- Proof steps are also missing, as indicated by "TODO: add proof".

Dependencies:
- The "view" function depends on accurately converting the struct’s internal Vec<u64> into a Seq<bool>.
- Each function (from, get_bit, set_bit, or) depends on having correct requires/ensures clauses.
- Proofs for bitwise correctness depend on the macros (get_bit64_macro, set_bit64_macro) and the bit_vector solver.
- The struct’s type invariants (if any) depend on how the bitmap’s length or structure is enforced.

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
A Full Sequence Workflow is required because the code explicitly contains a "view" method with a "TODO: implement view". This indicates the need for View inference and refinement. Additionally, since BitMap is a struct, we include the inv_inference step. Multiple methods also need specification clauses, so spec_inference is included, and the "TODO: add proof" comment triggers proof_generation.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes - the input defines a struct (BitMap) which needs invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes - there is a "TODO: add proof" marker requiring a final proof step.
