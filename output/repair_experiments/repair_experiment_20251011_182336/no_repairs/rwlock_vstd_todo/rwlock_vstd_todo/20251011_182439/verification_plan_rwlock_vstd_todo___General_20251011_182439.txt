Current State:
- The code defines a struct (FixedParity) that implements RwLockPredicate, but its inv function is missing the body (marked with "TODO: add specification").
- No other invariants or View functions are requested in the code.
- No "TODO: add proof" or "TODO: add invariants" markers are present.

Dependencies:
- The inv function in FixedParity directly impacts the RwLock usage, as it must ensure the correct parity constraint.
- No additional dependencies for View or invariants exist since there are no references to a View function or type invariants.

```

```markdown
**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
The code does not request a View function and does not have any "TODO: add invariants" markers. It only includes a "TODO: add specification" for the inv function, indicating that function specifications are needed without requiring new invariants. Therefore the Specification-Only Workflow is appropriate.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No – the struct does not need additional type invariants beyond the predicate function.
- proof_generation: No – there is no "TODO: add proof" marker present.
```
