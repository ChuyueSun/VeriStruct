### Step 1: Analyze the task

In this code, there is a custom data structure RwLock with a concurrency/token-based specification already in place. The main gap appears in the FixedParity type, whose inv function is left unimplemented (not returning any boolean condition). Aside from that, the RwLock structure includes its own concurrency invariants and a built-in token mechanism. Therefore, we do not need to introduce an additional “View” function for the lock or to infer invariants around its internal concurrency structure. We only need to supply the missing specification logic for FixedParity, namely that “v % 2 == self.parity.”

### Step 2: Choose the Workflow

**Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow  
**Explanation:** The code already has a sufficiently detailed concurrency specification via the tokenized state machine, so we do not need to define a brand-new data structure view. The principal missing piece is simply providing a specification in FixedParity::inv. Thus, we can go straight to adding the necessary specification.
