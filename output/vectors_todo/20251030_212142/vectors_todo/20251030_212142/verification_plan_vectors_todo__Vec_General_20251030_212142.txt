## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code consists of standalone functions (binary_search, reverse, binary_search_no_spinoff) without any custom data structures.
- Multiple “TODO: add specification” placeholders exist, indicating missing function spec clauses.
- Multiple “TODO: add invariants” placeholders exist, but they refer to loop invariants rather than type invariants.

Dependencies:
- No class/struct is present, so no type-invariant-based refinements are needed.
- Only function-level specification and loop proofs are required.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
- There is no class/struct data structure; therefore, type invariants are not needed.
- There are multiple “TODO: add specification” markers, so function specifications must be inferred.
- Although there are “TODO: add invariants,” these refer to loop invariants (not type invariants). No mention of “View” or a need for a View function.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference
2. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No (no class/struct data structure present)
- proof_generation: Yes (due to “TODO: add invariants” markers)
