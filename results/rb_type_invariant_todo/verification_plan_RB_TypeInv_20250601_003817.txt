### Step 1: Analyze the task

The code defines a RingBuffer<T> data structure with a partial implementation of the View trait (which is currently empty), indicating that a formal mathematical abstraction (i.e., a view function) for the ring is needed. Additionally, the ring buffer has a type_invariant that is yet to be specified, as well as several public functions (enqueue, dequeue, is_full, etc.) that lack concrete requires/ensures clauses. Because there is a custom data structure whose behavior we need to abstract with a proper View and corresponding invariants, the verification task requires more than just function specifications.

### Step 2: Choose the Workflow

**Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow  
**Explanation:** Since a custom data structure RingBuffer<T> needs a view function for its abstraction in addition to invariants and function specifications, the appropriate workflow is view_inference → view_refinement → inv_inference → spec_inference.
