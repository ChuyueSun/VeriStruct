## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code comprises several free functions (binary_search, reverse, etc.) without any custom data structure definitions.
- The code has placeholders for function specifications ("TODO: add specification") and loop invariants ("TODO: add invariants").
- There is no mention of a “View” or of any custom types requiring a type invariant.

Dependencies:
- The functions depend on correct requires/ensures specifications and loop invariants for verification.
- Each function must have proof obligations satisfied (i.e., the loop invariants and any additional needed proofs).

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
1. There are no custom class/struct data structures defined in the code, so no type invariants or view functions are required.
2. The code only includes tasks to add function specifications and loop invariants, which fits with the Specification-Only approach.
3. Since there is a “TODO: add invariants,” we will append a proof_generation step.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference
2. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No – because there are no custom data structures requiring type invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes – due to the presence of “TODO: add invariants.”
```
