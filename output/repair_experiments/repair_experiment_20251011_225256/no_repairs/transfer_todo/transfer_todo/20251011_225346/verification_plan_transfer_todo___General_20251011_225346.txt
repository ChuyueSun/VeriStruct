Current State:
- The code defines a simple Account struct and a transfer function without any requires/ensures.
- There is a "TODO: add requires and ensures" placeholder but no mention of invariants or View functions.
- No additional invariants or proofs are requested.

Dependencies:
- transfer function correctness depends on specifying valid pre/post conditions related to amounts and balances.
- No struct-level invariants or View dependencies are indicated.

```

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
The code contains a struct but does not request type invariants or mention "TODO: add invariants." The only placeholders are related to function specifications ("TODO: add requires and ensures"). There are no indications of needing View functions or invariants.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No – the code does not request or require type invariants.
- proof_generation: No – there is no "TODO: add proof" or "TODO: add invariants" marker.
```
