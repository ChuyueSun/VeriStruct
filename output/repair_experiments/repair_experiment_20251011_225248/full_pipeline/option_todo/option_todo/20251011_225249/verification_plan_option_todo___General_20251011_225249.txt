## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- Multiple functions (is_Some, is_None, get_Some_0, Or, etc.) have “TODO: add specification” or “TODO: add requires and ensures” placeholders.
- No references to a View function or type invariants are present.
- No “TODO: add proof” or “TODO: add invariants” markers appear in the code.

Dependencies:
- The MyOption enum is self-contained; no external invariants or View dependencies.
- Specifications for MyOption methods depend on each function’s intended behavior.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
Only function specifications need to be inferred (there are “TODO: add requires/ensures” markers). No invariants or View implementations are required, thus we do not include inv_inference or view_inference/view_refinement. There are no “TODO: add proof” or “TODO: add invariants” markers, so we do not include proof_generation.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No – the code does not contain a struct/enum requiring type invariants.
- proof_generation: No – there is no “TODO: add proof” or “TODO: add invariants” present.
```
