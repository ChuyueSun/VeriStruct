# Prompt

## System
You are a helpful AI assistant specialized in Verus formal verification.

## Instruction

You are a highly experienced expert in Verus (the verifier for Rust). Your task is to refine the "View" function within the given Verus file. The "View" function is the mathematical abstraction for a data structure, capturing the minimal information needed for its specification in Verus.

It is perfectly acceptable to leave the code unchanged if the current abstraction is already appropriate; modify the "View" function only when necessary.

**CRITICAL: DO NOT "refine" sequential/indexed data into sets!**
  - If the current view is `Seq<T>` (e.g., `Seq<bool>` for bitmaps), **KEEP IT AS Seq<T>**
  - DO NOT change `Seq<bool>` to `(nat, Set<nat>)` - this makes verification extremely difficult
  - Sequential data structures (bitmaps, arrays, buffers) REQUIRE Seq for indexed access and update operations
  - **"More succinct" does NOT mean "better for verification"**

Your responsibilities:
  1. Analyze the current "View" function to determine if its tuple (or other structure) adequately represents the module.
  2. Evaluate whether the abstraction can be improved. (Hint: If the tuple is identical to the internal fields, that is likely not an ideal abstraction.)
  3. **EXCEPTION**: If the current view is `Seq<T>` for indexed/sequential data (bitmaps, arrays, vectors), DO NOT change it - `Seq<T>` is the correct abstraction!
  4. Modify only the "View" function to improve its abstraction while leaving all other parts of the file unchanged.
  5. Any refined view must convey at least the same amount of information. For non-sequential data, aim to use a flattened tuple that is shorter than the original.
  6. **IMPORTANT**: Do not remove any "// TODO" markers in the code. Preserve all TODO comments exactly as they appear.
  7. Return the **entire updated Verus file** with your refined "View" function (or the original file if no changes were necessary) and nothing else changed.

**Common patterns to PRESERVE (do not change these)**:
  - `Seq<bool>` for bitmaps → Keep as `Seq<bool>`
  - `Seq<T>` for Vec<T> or Array<T> → Keep as `Seq<T>`
  - `Seq<T>` for ring buffers, queues → Keep as `Seq<T>`

**Common patterns that CAN be refined**:
  - Tuple of raw fields → Abstract mathematical properties
  - Redundant information → Remove duplicates
  - Complex nested tuples → Flatten when possible

# Verus Common Knowledge

## Important Notes
- ALWAYS use parentheses whenever possible for clarity!
- Don't delete existing non-buggy `#[trigger]`!
- Don't change "unwind" to `(unwind) as bool`!
- Return the complete modified Rust code in your response without explanations.
- Keep top level docstrings at the top of the file, before `verus! {`. Do not place them after the `verus! {` declaration.
- Don't change any function signatures.

## Spec Functions
1. No Direct Method Calls:
   In a spec function, you cannot directly call instance methods such as vector.is_full().
2. Use the @ Operator:
   To invoke methods on a variable within a spec, first convert it to its specification-level representation View with @.
3. Always use vector.len() instead of vector@.len().
4. Simplify Boolean Conjunctions:
   When combining multiple conditions, avoid excessive &&&. Fewer (or well-structured) conjunctions make the spec code easier to read and debug.
5. Parentheses Usage:
   ALWAYS wrap conditions in parentheses, even for simple expressions. This makes precedence explicit and prevents errors.

## Operators
Verus extends Rust logical operators with low-precedence forms that are especially helpful in specification code:

Standard Operators: &&, ||, ==>, <==>
Low-Precedence Variants: &&& and |||

The meaning of &&& is the same as && (logical AND), and ||| is the same as || (logical OR), but with lower precedence. This allows you to write conditions in a "bulleted list" style that remains grouped in a logical manner:

```
&&& a ==> b
&&& c
&&& d <==> e && f
```

is equivalent to:

```
(a ==> b) && c && (d <==> (e && f))
```

Note:
- Implication (==>) and equivalence (<==>) bind more tightly than &&& and |||.
- Using &&&/||| can make long specifications clearer by grouping logical clauses neatly.


# Verus View Function Guidelines

## View Refinement Guidelines
1. A good View abstraction should:
   - Represent the essential state of the data structure, not just copy its fields
   - Hide implementation details while preserving behavior
   - Be as simple as possible while being complete

2. Common refinements:
   - For collections (arrays, lists): Use Seq<T> instead of raw arrays
   - For indices: Use meaningful representations (e.g., range of valid elements)
   - For flag fields: Consider if they can be derived from other state

3. Avoid redundancy:
   - Only include fields necessary for specification
   - Derive computable properties in method ensures clauses, not in the view

4. Prefer mathematical types over concrete types when possible


# Verus Match Syntax Guidelines

## Using `matches!` Macro

In Verus, the `matches!` macro must use Rust's standard macro syntax:

```rust
// CORRECT
pub open spec fn is_Some<A>(opt: MyOption<A>) -> bool {
    matches!(opt, MyOption::Some(_))
}

// INCORRECT - don't use this syntax
pub open spec fn is_Some<A>(opt: MyOption<A>) -> bool {
    matches opt {
        MyOption::Some(_) => true,
        MyOption::None => false,
    }
}
```

## Match with `arbitrary()` in Spec Functions

When writing spec functions that match on patterns with impossible/unreachable branches, use `arbitrary()` instead of `unreachable!()`:

```rust
// CORRECT
pub open spec fn get_Some_0<A>(opt: MyOption<A>) -> A
    recommends is_Some(opt)
{
    match opt {
        MyOption::Some(a) => a,
        MyOption::None => arbitrary(), // For unreachable branches in spec functions
    }
}

// INCORRECT
pub open spec fn get_Some_0<A>(opt: MyOption<A>) -> A
    recommends is_Some(opt)
{
    match opt {
        MyOption::Some(a) => a,
        MyOption::None => unreachable!(), // Don't use this in spec functions
    }
}
```

## Match in Executable Functions

For unreachable branches in executable functions, use `unreached()`:

```rust
pub fn unwrap(self) -> (a: A)
    requires
        is_Some(self),
    ensures
        a == get_Some_0(self),
{
    match self {
        MyOption::Some(a) => a,
        MyOption::None => unreached(), // For unreachable branches in exec functions
    }
}
```

## Match in Proof Functions

For unreachable branches in proof functions, use `proof_from_false()`:

```rust
pub proof fn tracked_unwrap(tracked self) -> (tracked a: A)
    requires
        is_Some(self),
    ensures
        a == get_Some_0(self),
{
    match self {
        MyOption::Some(a) => a,
        MyOption::None => proof_from_false(), // For unreachable branches in proof functions
    }
}
```


# Verus Sequence Knowledge

Seq<T> is a mathematical sequence type used in specifications:

- Building: Seq::empty(), seq![x, y, z], Seq::singleton(x)
- Length: s.len()
- Indexing: s[i] (0-based)
- Subrange: s.subrange(lo, hi) gives elements from index lo (inclusive) to hi (exclusive)
- Concatenation: s1 + s2
- Update: s.update(i, v) returns a new sequence with index i updated to value v
- Contains: s.contains(v) checks if v is in the sequence
- Push/pop: s.push(v), s.pop() (returns new sequence, doesn't modify original)
- Equality: Use `=~=` for sequence equality, NOT `==` (e.g., `seq1 =~= seq2`, `self@.0 =~= old(self)@.0.subrange(1, (old(self)@.0.len()) as int)`)

You can use forall or exists for properties over sequences.

## CRITICAL: Postconditions for Seq<T> Update Operations

**For functions that update a single element in a sequence-based view**:

**✅ PREFER** - Use `.update()` for succinct, provable specifications:
```rust
fn update_element(&mut self, idx: usize, value: T)
    requires
        idx < old(self)@.len(),
    ensures
        self@ == old(self)@.update(idx as int, value),  // ✅ Succinct!
```

**❌ AVOID** - Verbose element-wise specifications (makes proofs much harder):
```rust
ensures
    self@.len() == old(self)@.len(),
    forall|i: int| 0 <= i && i < self@.len() && i != idx as int ==> self@[i] == old(self)@[i],
    self@[idx as int] == value,
```

**Why `.update()` is better**:
1. More concise and readable
2. Directly matches proof patterns (pairs with `assert_seqs_equal!`)
3. Easier for Verus SMT solver to reason about
4. Standard pattern in Verus for sequence modifications

**When to use this pattern**:
- Any function that modifies exactly one position in a Seq-based view
- After operations that update a single element (e.g., `self.data.set(index, value)`)
- Functions with postconditions about changing one element while preserving others

## Subrange Usage

1. Cast indices to `int`: `self.head as int`, not just `self.head`
2. Use `.subrange(start, end)`, not `seq[start..end]`
3. Wrap complex expressions: `(..).subrange((expression) as int, ...)`
4. For full length: `(sequence.len()) as int`

## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- A RingBuffer<T> struct is defined, along with various methods (enqueue, dequeue, etc.) containing "TODO: add proof" comments.
- An explicit "impl View for RingBuffer<T>" block exists with "TODO: add specification", indicating a need for a View function.
- The code has type_invariant usage ("#[verifier::type_invariant]") for the RingBuffer struct, showing that invariants are also required.
- Multiple function placeholders for requires/ensures and proof blocks are present.

Identified Missing Components:
- A proper View function implementation (the “impl<T: Copy> View for RingBuffer<T>” block is incomplete).
- Invariants for the RingBuffer struct type_invariant.
- Requires/ensures specifications for all the RingBuffer methods.
- Proofs for each method’s correctness (leveraging the ring invariant, among other things).

Critical Verification Challenges:
- Ensuring the ring buffer’s head/tail wrap-around behaviors are accurately captured in the View and in the invariants.
- Proving that ring buffer operations maintain the ring invariant (type_invariant).
- Verifying that the proofs match the function specifications (e.g., correctness of enqueue/dequeue operations).

Dependencies:
- The “RingBuffer<T>” data structure depends on a consistent View definition for its abstract representation.
- The function specifications (requires/ensures) and invariants rely on the ring buffer’s abstract state and well-formedness conditions.
- Proof code depends on both the correctness of invariants and function specifications to discharge verification conditions.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
- The code explicitly requires a View implementation ("impl View for RingBuffer<T>") and thus needs a full set of steps (view_inference and view_refinement).
- There is a struct-based data structure (RingBuffer<T>), so inv_inference is also applicable.
- Various “TODO” entries indicate the need for invariants, specifications, and proofs.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
   (Generate an initial View function for the ring buffer’s mathematical abstraction.)
2. view_refinement
   (Refine and finalize the View definition to accurately capture the ring buffer state.)
3. inv_inference
   (Synthesize the type_invariant conditions for consistency of head/tail indices, etc.)
4. spec_inference
   (Infer the requires and ensures clauses for all methods, e.g., enqueue, dequeue, len, has_elements, etc.)
5. proof_generation
   (Finalize the proofs demanded by the “TODO: add proof” comments, ensuring each function’s correctness is verified.)

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes (the input is a struct with a type_invariant attribute).
- proof_generation: Yes (the code contains “TODO: add proof” placeholders).
