Current State:
- The code defines an enum MyOption<A> with several “TODO: add specification” and “TODO: add requires and ensures” markers.
- No “TODO: add invariants” or “TODO: add View” items are present, and there is no mention of implementing a View function.
- Therefore, no type invariants are requested for this enum, and the main focus is on function specifications.

Dependencies:
- The MyOption<A> enum’s functionality depends on correct specifications for is_Some, is_None, get_Some_0, Or, or, is_some, is_none, as_ref, and unwrap.
- No additional dependencies relate to invariants or View functions.

```

```markdown
**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
There are only “TODO: add specification” and “TODO: add requires and ensures” placeholders, indicating function specifications are needed. No View or invariant requests appear, so the Specification-Only Workflow is the most appropriate.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No – the enum does not require type invariants.
- proof_generation: No – there are no “TODO: add proof” or “TODO: add invariants” markers.
```
