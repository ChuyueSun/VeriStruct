Current State:
- The code defines a struct "BitMap" that clearly needs a view function, as indicated by the "TODO: implement view".
- Additional placeholders for "TODO: add requires and ensures" imply missing function specifications.
- There is also a "TODO: add proof" comment, requiring follow-up proof obligations.
- Therefore, a complete verification approach is needed, including a view function implementation, possible type invariants, function specs, and proof blocks.

Dependencies:
- The "BitMap" struct depends on a correct view function for proof obligations in other methods.
- Functions like "set_bit", "or", etc. depend on proper preconditions, postconditions, and invariants of "BitMap".
- Proof obligations (TODO notes) depend on properly refined views, invariants, and specifications.

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
Because the code explicitly declares a "view" function with "TODO: implement view", it requires a view-based verification. Moreover, the presence of a struct data structure indicates we should include invariant inference. Finally, there are placeholders for function specs and a "TODO: add proof" marker, making the Full Sequence Workflow the best fit.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – "BitMap" is a struct requiring potential invariants.
- proof_generation: Yes – There is a "TODO: add proof" comment.
```
