## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The BitMap struct is a data structure with an unimplemented spec function “view” that returns Seq<bool>, indicating a required View abstraction.
- Several methods (from, get_bit, set_bit, or) lack specification (requires/ensures) clauses.
- There are “TODO: add proof” markers in set_bit and a “TODO: add loop invariant” in or.
- These gaps prevent complete verification of all methods.

Identified Missing Components:
- Implementation of the view function for BitMap.
- Type invariants for BitMap (if needed).
- Requires/ensures for from, get_bit, set_bit, and or.
- Proof blocks for set_bit (and possibly or) and a loop invariant in or.

Critical Verification Challenges:
- Ensuring the internal u64 chunks correctly map to a Seq<bool> in view.
- Formulating the correct specifications for bitwise operations and verifying them with the bit_vector solver.
- Providing a loop invariant for the while loop in or that ensures correctness and termination.
- Completing the proof obligations where “TODO: add proof” is indicated.

Dependencies:
- The correctness of get_bit and set_bit rely on the correctness of the macros get_bit64_macro! and set_bit64_macro! (proved by set_bit64_proof).
- The or method’s correctness depends on bit_or_64_proof and the specification of view for ensuring correctness at the specification level.
- The view function is central to verifying that the representation in bits aligns with the abstract sequence of bools.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
This code contains a struct (BitMap) with an explicit spec function named “view” that must be implemented. The presence of “view” indicates a required View abstraction, triggering the Full Sequence Workflow. Since BitMap is a data structure, we include the inv_inference step. Additionally, “TODO: add proof” is present, so proof_generation will be appended.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes – BitMap is a struct data structure, so type invariants may be inferred.
- proof_generation: Yes – “TODO: add proof” is present in set_bit (and potentially or).
```
