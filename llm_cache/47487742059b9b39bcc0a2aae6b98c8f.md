# Prompt

## System
You are a helpful AI assistant specialized in Verus formal verification.

## Instruction
You are an expert in Verus (verifier for rust). You have two main tasks:

TASK 1: Add `requires` and `ensures` to public functions where you see "// TODO: add requires and ensures"
   - Analyze the semantics of functions and add appropriate preconditions and postconditions
   - Change function signatures to `-> (retname: rettype)` format when adding return value specifications
   - Use precise, mathematical specifications that capture the function's behavior

TASK 2: Fill in `spec fn` implementations where you see "TODO: add specification"
   - Implement the specification function based on the context and function name

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
   - DO NOT just copy the implementation code in specifications
   - You may use `self.view().XXX` or `self@XXX` in `ensures` clauses
   - If `self.view()` is a tuple, you can use `self@.i` to access the i-th element (zero-indexed)
   - DO NOT use `old` without consideration: "only a variable binding is allowed as the argument to old"
   - DO NOT use `match` or `let` in the `ensures` clause or `requires` clause, but you can use `match` within `spec fn` bodies
   - DO NOT modify anything in `fn main()`
   - DO NOT add `self.inv()` to pre/post-conditions if `#[verifier::type_invariant]` is used
   - Spec functions (like View) cannot have their own requires/ensures clauses
   
RETURN FORMAT:
   - Return the ENTIRE file with your changes integrated into the original code, not just the parts you modified

# Verus Common Knowledge

## Important Notes
- Don't delete existing non-buggy `#[trigger]`!
- Don't change "unwind" to `(unwind) as bool`!
- Return the complete modified Rust code in your response without explanations.
- Keep top level docstrings at the top of the file, before `verus! {`. Do not place them after the `verus! {` declaration.

## Spec Functions
1. No Direct Method Calls:
   In a spec function, you cannot directly call instance methods such as vector.is_full().
2. Use the @ Operator:
   To invoke methods on a variable within a spec, first convert it to its specification-level representation View with @.
3. Always use vector.len() instead of vector@.len().
4. Simplify Boolean Conjunctions:
   When combining multiple conditions, avoid excessive &&&. Fewer (or well-structured) conjunctions make the spec code easier to read and debug.

## Operators
Verus extends Rust logical operators with low-precedence forms that are especially helpful in specification code:

Standard Operators: &&, ||, ==>, <==>
Low-Precedence Variants: &&& and |||

The meaning of &&& is the same as && (logical AND), and ||| is the same as || (logical OR), but with lower precedence. This allows you to write conditions in a "bulleted list" style that remains grouped in a logical manner:

```
&&& a ==> b
&&& c
&&& d <==> e && f
```

is equivalent to:

```
(a ==> b) && c && (d <==> (e && f))
```

Note:
- Implication (==>) and equivalence (<==>) bind more tightly than &&& and |||.
- Using &&&/||| can make long specifications clearer by grouping logical clauses neatly.


# Verus Requires and Ensures Guidelines

## Formatting for `requires` and `ensures`

```rust
fn func(arg) -> rettype
    requires
        REQUIREMENT1,
        REQUIREMENT2,
        ...
    ensures
        ENSUREMENT1,
        ENSUREMENT2,
        if COND {
            &&& ENSUREMENT3_1
            &&& ENSUREMENT3_2
        } else {
            &&& ENSUREMENT4_1
            &&& ENSUREMENT4_2
        }
        ...
```

- In requires, use `old(self)` to refer to the pre-state of an &mut variable.
- When using the return value in an `ensures` clause, assign it a name if not already provided (change the return type of the function), e.g.:

```rust
fn func(arg) -> (retname: rettype)
```

- When using if-else blocks in ensures clauses, always use `&&&` instead of `&&` to connect multiple conditions, as shown in the example above.



# Verus Match Syntax Guidelines

## Using `matches!` Macro

In Verus, the `matches!` macro must use Rust's standard macro syntax:

```rust
// CORRECT
pub open spec fn is_Some<A>(opt: MyOption<A>) -> bool {
    matches!(opt, MyOption::Some(_))
}

// INCORRECT - don't use this syntax
pub open spec fn is_Some<A>(opt: MyOption<A>) -> bool {
    matches opt {
        MyOption::Some(_) => true,
        MyOption::None => false,
    }
}
```

## Match with `arbitrary()` in Spec Functions

When writing spec functions that match on patterns with impossible/unreachable branches, use `arbitrary()` instead of `unreachable!()`:

```rust
// CORRECT
pub open spec fn get_Some_0<A>(opt: MyOption<A>) -> A
    recommends is_Some(opt)
{
    match opt {
        MyOption::Some(a) => a,
        MyOption::None => arbitrary(), // For unreachable branches in spec functions
    }
}

// INCORRECT
pub open spec fn get_Some_0<A>(opt: MyOption<A>) -> A
    recommends is_Some(opt)
{
    match opt {
        MyOption::Some(a) => a,
        MyOption::None => unreachable!(), // Don't use this in spec functions
    }
}
```

## Match in Executable Functions

For unreachable branches in executable functions, use `unreached()`:

```rust
pub fn unwrap(self) -> (a: A)
    requires
        is_Some(self),
    ensures
        a == get_Some_0(self),
{
    match self {
        MyOption::Some(a) => a,
        MyOption::None => unreached(), // For unreachable branches in exec functions
    }
}
```

## Match in Proof Functions

For unreachable branches in proof functions, use `proof_from_false()`:

```rust
pub proof fn tracked_unwrap(tracked self) -> (tracked a: A)
    requires
        is_Some(self),
    ensures
        a == get_Some_0(self),
{
    match self {
        MyOption::Some(a) => a,
        MyOption::None => proof_from_false(), // For unreachable branches in proof functions
    }
}

/// Macro to help set up boilerplate for specifying invariants when using
/// invariant-based datatypes.
///
/// This currently supports the `AtomicInvariant` and `LocalInvariant`
/// types, as well as all the `atomic_ghost` types (e.g., `AtomicU64`, `AtomicBool`, and so on).
/// It is important to first understand how these types work.
/// In particular, `LocalInvariant` (for example) takes three type parameters,
/// `K`, `V`, and `Pred: InvariantPredicate`.
/// The `InvariantPredicate` trait lets the user specify an invariant at the static type
/// level, while `K` allows the user to configure the invariant upon construction.
/// `AtomicInvariant` uses the same system, and the `atomic_ghost` types are similar
/// but use a different trait (`AtomicInvariantPredicate`).
///
/// However, setting all this up in a typical application tends to involve a bit
/// of boilerplate. That's where this macro comes in.
///
/// # Usage
///
/// The `struct_with_invariants!` macro is used at the item level, and it should contains
/// a single struct declaration followed by a single declaration of a `spec` function
/// returning `bool`. However, this spec function should not contain a boolean predicate
/// as usual, but instead a series of _invariant declarations_.
/// Each invariant declaration applies to a single field of the struct.
///
/// ```rust
/// struct_with_invariants!{
///     (pub)? struct $struct_name (<...>)? (where ...)? {
///         ( (pub)? $field_name: $type, )*
///     }
///
///     (pub)? (open|closed)? spec fn(&self (, ...)?) $fn_name {
///         ( InvariantDecl | BoolPredicateDecl )*
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// A field of the struct, if it uses a supported type, may leave the type _incomplete_ by
/// omitting some of its type parameters.
/// The following are valid incomplete types:
///
///  * `LocalInvariant<_, V, _>`
///  * `AtomicInvariant<_, V, _>`
///  * `AtomicBool<_, G, _>`
///  * `AtomicU64<_, G, _>`
///    * ... and so on for the other `atomic_ghost` types.
///
/// There must be exactly one invariant declaration for each incomplete type used in the
/// struct declaration. The macro uses invariant declarations to fill in the type parameters.
///
/// The user can also provide boolean predicate declarations, which are copied verbatim
/// into the `$fn_name` definition. This is a convenience, since it is common to want
/// to add extra conditions, and it is fairly straightforward.
/// The complex part of the macro expansion in the invariant declarations.
///
/// ```rust
/// BoolPredicateDecl  :=  predicate { $bool_expr }
///
/// InvariantDecl  :=
///     invariant on $field_name
///         ( with ($dependencies) )?
///         ( forall | ($ident: $type, )* | )?
///         ( where ($where_expr) )?
///         ( specifically ($specifically_expr) )?
///         is ($params) {
///             $bool_expr
///         }
/// ```
///
/// In the `InvariantDecl`, the user always needs to provide the following data:
///
///  * The `$field_name` is the field that this invariant applies to
///     (which must have an incomplete type as described above)
///  * The `$params` are the values constrained by the invariant.
///      * For a `LocalInvariant<V>` or `AtomicInvariant<V>`, this should be a single
///        parameter of type `V`.
///      * For an `atomic_ghost` type, this should consist of two parameters,
///        first the primitive type stored by the atomic, and secondly one of the ghost type, `G`.
///        (For example, the type `AtomicBool<_, G, _>` should have two parameters
///        here, `b: bool, g: G`.)
///  * Finally, the `$bool_expr` is the invariant predicate, which may reference any of
///     the fields declared in `$dependencies`, or any of the params.
///
/// The other input clauses handle additional complexities that often comes up.
/// For example, it is often necessary for the invariant to refer to the values of other fields
/// in the struct.
///
///  * The `with` input gives the list of field names (other fields
///     from the struct definition) that may be referenced from
///     the body of this invariant.
///     The graph of dependencies across all fields must be acyclic.
///
/// Finally, when the field is a _container_ type, e.g., `vec: Vec<AtomicU64<_, G, _>>` or
/// `opt: Option<AtomicU64<_, G, _>>`, there are some additional complexities.
/// We might need the invariant to be conditional (e.g., for an optional, the invariant would only
/// exist if `opt.is_Some()`).
/// We might need to quantify over a variable (e.g., in a vector, we want to specify an invariant
/// for each element, element `i` where `0 <= i < vec.len()`).
/// Finally, we need to indicate the value actually getting the invariant (e.g., `self.vec[i]`).
///
/// * The `forall` lets you specify additional bound variables. Everything after the `forall`---the
///   `where`, the `specifically`, and finally the `$bool_expr$`---can all reference these bound variables.
/// * The `where` lets you specify an additional hypothesis that the invariant is dependent on.
/// * The `specifically` lets you indicate the value getting the invariant.
///
/// This all roughly means, "forall instantiations of the quantified variables, if the condition `$where_expr` holds,
/// then the value given by `$specifically_expr` has the invariant given by `$bool_expr`.
/// See the detailed information on the macro-expansion below for more details.
///
/// Given all the information from the `InvariantDecl`, the macro fills in the `_` placeholders as follows:
///
///  * The macro fills in the `K` type as the types of the fields marked as dependencies and
///    the quantified variables in the forall (packing all these types into a tuple if necessary).
///  * The macro fills in the `Pred` type by creating a new type and implementing the appropriate
///    trait with the user-provided predicate.

### verification_plan

### Step 1: Analyze the task

The code defines a simple variant type “MyOption” that is conceptually very similar to the standard Option type. Its internal structure is straightforward—either None or Some(A)—and does not appear to require a dedicated View function for an abstracted model. Rather, it primarily needs specification (requires/ensures) for its public spec functions (like is_Some, is_None, get_Some_0) and its methods (like or, is_some, is_none, etc.). Because this data structure is simple and self-contained, it is most suitable to add specifications directly rather than introduce a View.

### Step 2: Choose the Workflow

**Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow  
**Explanation:** The MyOption enum has a simple structure that does not require a separate View function. It only needs requires/ensures clauses and possibly simple specification statements. Therefore, the specification-only workflow is sufficient.
