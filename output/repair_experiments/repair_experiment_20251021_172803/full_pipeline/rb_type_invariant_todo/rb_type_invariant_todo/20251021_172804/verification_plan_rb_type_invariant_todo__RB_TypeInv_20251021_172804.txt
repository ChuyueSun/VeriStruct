## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code implements a RingBuffer struct and explicitly derives the View trait, indicating the need for a view function.
- Multiple methods in the RingBuffer struct have “TODO: add requires and ensures” placeholders, indicating missing specifications.
- Several “TODO: add proof” markers exist, signaling that proof blocks need to be added.
- The struct also has a type invariant “inv” with “TODO: add specification” still unfilled.

Dependencies:
- The RingBuffer’s correctness relies on a proper view function and type invariant.
- Each RingBuffer method depends on appropriate requires/ensures clauses and the type invariant for correctness proofs.
- The final proofs (e.g., for lemma_mod_auto or ring buffer methods) rely on the ring buffer’s view, invariant, and specifications being fully defined.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Full Sequence Workflow

**Justification:**
- The code explicitly mentions “View” (in the “impl<T: Copy> View for RingBuffer<T>” block).
- It also contains a struct (RingBuffer) needing invariants and requires/ensures clauses, plus “TODO: add proof” markers.
- Therefore, the Full Sequence Workflow is required to define the ring buffer’s View and fill in type invariants, specifications, and proofs.

**Execution Steps:**
1. view_inference
2. view_refinement
3. inv_inference
4. spec_inference
5. proof_generation

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: Yes (we have a RingBuffer struct needing a type invariant).
- proof_generation: Yes (multiple “TODO: add proof” markers are present).
