## 1. Analysis Summary

Current State:
- The code defines a simple struct "Account" with a balance field of type u64.
- There is a function "transfer" with a TODO to add requires and ensures clauses.
- No mention of struct invariants or View functions.
- No TODO for adding proofs or invariants.

Dependencies:
- The function "transfer" depends on properly specified pre- and post-conditions.
- The test function "test" checks basic correctness but relies on "transfer"’s specification.

## 2. Verification Plan

**Selected Workflow:** Specification-Only Workflow

**Justification:**
Since there is a struct but no explicit request or indication that type invariants are needed, and the only stated TODO is to add requires/ensures for the function, the Specification-Only Workflow is the most appropriate. There are no View requirements or references, and no indication that invariants must be defined.

**Execution Steps:**
1. spec_inference

**Module Conditions:**
- inv_inference: No (the code does not request invariants for the struct)
- proof_generation: No (no "TODO: add proof" found)
```
